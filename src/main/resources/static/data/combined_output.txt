Cookies, web beacons, and other automatic data collection technologies on the Services may come from third parties such as Google Analytics or Shopify. For more information about these data collection technologies, please see our detailed Cookies Policy. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Additionally, other online resources, such as Privacy Badger from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, are available that can help block certain automatic data collection technologies. Please note that, if you disable or refuse cookies or other automatic data collection technologies such as web beacons, some aspects of the Services may be inaccessible or not function properly. From Third Parties We may receive your Personal Information from or through third parties that help us provide or facilitate your access to the Services, including those listed below. Digital content stores and game platforms such as those operated by Valve Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Examples below. If you play the Game using Steam, we may receive your Steam ID (but we do not store it). If you play the Game using a mobile application, we may receive your phone model and certain gameplay information from Microsoft. We abide by this Policy when we use Personal Data provided to us by third parties. However, we may not control the Personal Data that third parties collect or how they use that Personal Data. You should review the third parties privacy policies for more information about how they collect, use, and share the Personal Data they obtain and usefor example: Google LLC; Microsoft Corp.; Apple Inc.; Valve Corp.; and Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC. 5. For what purposes do we collect your Personal Data? We may collect your Personal Data for the below purposes. To provide or improve the Services: We may use your Personal Data to process your requests to access the Services and certain of their features and to generally present and improve the Services. For example, when you create a profile on the Forum, we may use your Personal Data to present the Forum to you and to notify you about activity on the Forum. By way of another example, when you purchase a product from the Shop, we may use your Personal Data to charge and ship the product to you. To administer the Services: We may use your Personal Data for any lawful business or operational purpose in connection with administering the Services. For example, if you reach out to us, we may use your Personal Data to respond to you or to troubleshoot a problem you reported having with the Services. To market the Services: We may use your Personal Data to market the Services to you. For example, with your prior consent, we may send you news and updates about our products and the Services via email. In furtherance of legal and safety objectives: We may access, use, and share with others your Personal Data for purposes of safety and other matters in the public interest. We may also provide access to your Personal Data to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings (e.g., in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal processes). We may also provide access to your Personal Data to protect our rights and property and those of our agents, users, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and our Terms of Use. For example, if you post to the Forum, we may monitor and store those communications to detect cheating, fraud, illegal activity, or other activities that may violate our Terms of Use. In connection with a sale or other transfer of our business: In the event all or some of our assets are sold, assigned, or transferred to or acquired by another company due to a sale, merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, financing, bankruptcy, or otherwise, your Personal Data may be among the transferred assets. As we may describe to you when collecting your Personal Data: There may be other situations when we collect your Personal Data and simultaneously describe the purpose for that collection. Lawful Basis We only collect, use, or store your Personal Data for a lawful basis such as: you voluntarily provide it to us with your specific, informed, and unambiguous consent (for example, when you sign up for our newsletter); it is necessary to provide you with a Service that you have requested (for example, providing you access to the Forum or shipping a purchased product from the Shop to you); we have a legitimate business interest that is not outweighed by your privacy rights (for example, to respond to your inquiries); or it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of others (for example, where necessary to protect the safety of one of our users or someone else). 6. In what situations do we disclose your Personal Data? We may disclose your Personal Data to a third party, such as a service provider or contractor for a business or operational purpose, or with your consent. When we disclose Personal Data for a business or operational purpose, we enter into a contract with the service provider or contractor that describes the purpose and requires the service provider or contractor to both keep that Personal Data confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. These service providers and contractors include our: e-commerce service providers; moderation service providers; and data analytic service providers. We may also disclose your Personal Data: to our subsidiaries and affiliates; to our lawyers, consultants, accountants, business advisors, and similar third parties who owe us duties of confidentiality; to a buyer or other successor in the event of a sale, merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Data retained by us pertaining to the users of the Services is among the assets transferred; to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, such as responding to a government or regulatory request; to enforce any contract we may have in effect with you; if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others; and if you have consented to such a disclosure. We do not sell, rent, or share your Personal Data for cross contextual behavioral or targeted advertising, automated decision-making, or profiling purposes. 7. How is my Personal Data protected? Our Retention, Purpose Limitation, and Security Policies We protect your Personal Data through a combination of collection, security, and retention policies. Limited retention: We retain each category of Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Data was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce contracts. For example, we may retain Personal Data collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Use if your profile has been banned or your access to the Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Data, the purposes for which we process the Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our policy to delete your Personal Data if we stop operating our Game or the feature through which the Personal Data was acquired. Purpose limitation: We will use your Personal Data only for the Services you choose to access and for the purposes notified to you, unless we otherwise obtain your consent. We limit the collection of Personal Data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes. Security measures: We use reasonable security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Data processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. For example, we use a secure server. All supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted. Such information is only accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems and that are required to keep the information confidential, subject to any additional requirements imposed by our contract with them and applicable law. As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Policy does not guarantee the security of your Personal Data. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach to the extent required by applicable law. Your Practices and Activities Your practices and activities are likewise very important for the protection of your Personal Data. You should take certain steps to help protect your Personal Data, such as being mindful of what you share publicly on the Services, including the below. Do not use your real name when selecting a username. Do not post your real name or anything private about yourself or anyone else in public-facing areas of the Services. Do not pick a password that is easy to guess, and do not share your password. Please remember that we have no control over what other users do with the content of your communications and no responsibility or obligation regarding other users. 8. How do we treat Personal Data transferred to the United States? Place of Business We may store or process your Personal Data outside of the country where we collect the information or the country in which you reside. Our primary place of business is in the United States. You should understand that we may transfer some or all of your Personal Data to the United States to carry out certain operational and processing needs as described in this Policy. Transfer Mechanisms When transferring Personal Data out of foreign countries, we implement technical, organizational, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Data. We use European Commission approved standard contractual clauses and implement related measures where required by applicable law. Please contact us if you have questions related to the relevant transfer mechanism for your Personal Data. 9. What rights do you have to your Personal Data? Right to Access, Correct, Delete, or Restrict Processing Subject to any limitations and exceptions under applicable law, you have the right to request access to your Personal Data and exercise the below rights. You have the right to correct or update certain types of Personal Data. In many cases, you can review or update your profile information by accessing your profile online. You have the right to request deletion of your Personal Data. If you choose to have your Personal Data removed from the Services, we will carry out your request within 30 days of verification, subject to extension, and we will only retain minimal Personal Data to document your request and the actions we took to carry out your request. You have the right to restrict certain processing of your Personal Data and the right to object to some types of processing of your Personal Data. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our collection, storage, or processing of your Personal Data with a data protection supervisory authority in the country where you live or work. We will comply with your requests in accordance with, and subject to, applicable law. For example, we are not required to delete your Personal Data if we have an overriding legitimate ground for retaining that information, such as to prevent fraud. Please note that we are legally prohibited from carrying out requested actions in some instances, including (1) when we are unable to confirm your identity or (2) where doing so would adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others. Further, we are not required to carry out a requested action in some instances, including where the request is considered excessive.

Additional Notice for California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia Residents California Online Privacy Protection Act The following applies to California residents: We do not track users of the Services over time and across third party websites or online services and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track signals. We are not aware of any third party that tracks users of the Services over time and across third party websites or online services.

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers and contractors to delete) your Personal Data from our records, unless an exception under applicable law applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers or contractors to: complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Data, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide the Services that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you; help to ensure the security and integrity of the Services to the extent the use of your Personal Data is reasonably necessary and proportionate to those purposes; debug the Services to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; exercise free speech, ensure the right of another user to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law; comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act; engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the Personal Datas deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the researchs achievement, if you previously provided consent; enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with user expectations based on your relationship with us and compatible with the context in which you provided the Personal Data; or comply with a legal obligation. Right to Correction: You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Data. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the inaccurate Personal Data, taking into account to the nature of the Personal Data and the purposes of the processing of the Personal Data. No Discrimination We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights under applicable law. Unless permitted by applicable law, we will not: deny you the Services; charge you different prices or rates for the Services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; provide you a different level or quality of the Services; or suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for the Services or a different level or quality of the Services. Verifiable Consumer Requests To exercise your rights described above, please email us at [email protected] with the subject line State Privacy Rights or mail your request to 701 N. 36th St., Suite 200, Seattle, WA 98103. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Data. The verifiable consumer request must: provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data or an authorized representative; and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Data relates to you. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. Response Timing and Format We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have a profile with us, we will deliver our written response to that profile. If you do not have a profile with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of verifiable consumer request, unless you request a longer period of time for Personal Data we collected about you after January 1, 2022. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. To appeal a decision regarding your verifiable consumer request, please submit your appeal using one of the two methods above. Your appeal should include an explanation of the reason you disagree with our decision. Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable, easy-to-understand, and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. 11. How will we notify you of changes to this Policy? We reserve the right to change this Policy from time to time consistent with applicable law. If we make changes to this Policy, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy and provide you with additional notice such as an in-Game notice, banner on the Websites, or email notification. 12.

For the achievement, see Achievements. The Legend is a fish that can be caught during Spring in the Mountain lake during rainy weather. It is one of the five Legendary Fish, so it can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer. The special requirements necessary to hook a Legend are:[1] Fishing level 10, either naturally or using Fishing Buffs. The bobber must be located in water with a Fishing Zone of 5, i.e., it must be at least five tiles away from any land (including bridges) in every direction. The Legend can appear one tile closer to land (Zone=3) if the bobber lands in bubbles. The region of the lake near the large submerged log meets this requirement, as suggested in Secrets of the Legendary Fish. However, there are other locations in the lake that also work. When all of these requirements are met, each cast has a 10% chance of hooking a Legend (20% if using a Curiosity Lure). Contrary to the information provided by The Fisherman, Act II, none of the other Legendary Fish need to be caught first. Although the Legend cannot be hooked again after it is caught, it is possible to obtain multiple Legends (per player) by using Challenge Bait to catch it or by Panning in the correct tiles with the Fisher enchantment. The Legend can be caught regardless of weather or season using Magic Bait. Contents 1 Map 2 Gifting 3 Bundles 4 Recipes 5 Dyeing 6 Quests 7 References 8

Watering Cans From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search The Watering Can is a tool obtained at the beginning of the game that is used to water Crops. It may be refilled at any water source, including the kitchen sink (if the player has an upgraded house). Every crop needs to be watered each day until fully grown. An immature crop that is not watered on any day does not die, but it does not grow either. Mature crops that produce multiple harvests also require daily watering. Crops planted outside do not need to be watered on days in which it rains. Crops grown indoors (like the Greenhouse and in Garden Pots) need to be watered regardless of weather, as rain does not cover them. Crops grown from Winter Seeds do need to be watered each day in Winter, even if it is snowing. Mature crops that produce a single harvest do not need to be watered, they may be left in place until the player wishes to harvest them. (Note that the formation of Giant Crops requires daily watering of mature plants.) Using Retaining Soil fertilizer allows crops to stay watered for extra days. Using Sprinklers allows multiple crops to be automatically watered throughout days. The Watering Can may be upgraded at the Blacksmith. The cost and resource requirements for each upgrade are shown in the table below.

Winter From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Winter is the fourth season in Stardew Valley. It is followed by Spring and preceded by Fall. Winter is unique amongst the seasons in that no outdoors Crops apart from Powdermelon Seeds, Winter Seeds and Fiber Seeds will grow, and all Weeds and most tilled soil (including all fertilizer, even if the tile remains tilled) will all be removed at the start of the season. Grass remains but does not spread. Bee Houses will also not produce honey during winter. Finally, standard trees, including those planted on the farm (except fruit trees) do not grow in winter unless Tree Fertilizer is applied. Overall, with plant growth stopped, Winter can become a challenging season for farmers, leaving only animal produce and the Greenhouse as the mainstay of farm produce. However, the reduced intensity of farming makes it an excellent season for other activities, including foraging, The Mines/Skull Cavern exploration, fishing, digging at artifact spots, and gift-giving - with nine birthdays, Winter is tied with Summer for most birthdays in a season. It also makes it easier to obtain Farm and Tool upgrades without impacting normal routines. Animals require additional care during this season, as they cannot go outside due to the cold. Providing them with a Heater will also make them happier. Additionally, due to the lack of grass and weeds, Fiber and Hay are more difficult to obtain outdoors. However fiber still can be found in the Mines and Mutant Bug Lair, or alternatively grown with Fiber Seeds. Hay can be purchased from Marnie's Ranch, or randomly gifted from her in the mail.

For the profession, see Fishing#Fishing Skill. See also: Ms. Angler The Angler is a fish that can be caught in Pelican Town during Fall. It is one of the five Legendary Fish, so it can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer. The special requirements necessary to hook an Angler are:[1] Fishing level 3, either naturally or using Fishing Buffs. The player must be standing at the northernmost end of the river (within 15 tiles of the map edge). This includes the wooden plank bridge, all shoreline north of the bridge, as well as the shoreline up to three tiles south of the wood bridge. There is no Fishing Zone requirement; the bobber can be located anywhere in the river as long as the player is standing in a valid location. When all of these requirements are met, each cast has a 20% chance of hooking an Angler (25% if using a Curiosity Lure). Although the Angler cannot be hooked again after it is caught, it is possible to obtain multiple Anglers (per player) by using Challenge Bait to catch it or by Panning in the correct tiles with the Fisher enchantment. The Angler can be caught regardless of season using Magic Bait. Contents 1 Map 2 Gifting 3 Bundles 4 Recipes 5 Dyeing 6 Quests 7 References 8

It automatically harvests all products produced by Coop animals when placed in a coop. It can be purchased from Marnie's Ranch for data-sort-value="25000">25,000g after obtaining Farming Level 10. Once unlocked, players may purchase as many Auto-Grabbers as they can afford. An Auto-Grabber may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern. Each morning, the Auto-Grabber will automatically harvest all products in the Barn or Coop where it is placed. The player does not gain any Farming experience points or Mastery points for products harvested by an Auto-Grabber. The Auto-Grabber acts like a chest, holding up to 36 harvested items (or stacks of harvested items). Items can be viewed or removed by right-clicking on the Auto-Grabber. Note that an empty Auto-Grabber cannot be opened. Auto-Grabbers can be placed anywhere, but will not do anything unless placed inside a barn or coop. To remove an Auto-Grabber, it must be struck with a tool (repeated left-clicking or holding left-click will not work). Auto-Grabbers cannot be sold or deconstructed. Animal Friendship The Auto-Grabber prevents the player from earning +5 friendship points for manually milking or shearing an animal. It will take longer for animals who have not reached the maximum of 5 hearts to do so, if placed in a barn with an Auto-Grabber. Keep in mind, animals will lose 5-10 friendship if not interacted with, meaning animals who aren't hand-pet, milked, or sheared, will lose friendship gradually, despite still being fed and let outside. This effect can be cancelled out by the use of an Auto-Petter. Mail The day after reaching Farming Level 10, the player will receive a letter in the mail from Marnie. It is not necessary to read this letter to be able to purchase Auto-Grabbers; they can be purchased as soon as Farming level 10 is achieved.  <Player>, I've got a new item in stock... It's called the "Auto-Grabber". This thing can milk your cows and goats, shear your sheep, gather eggs, and pluck your wooly rabbits... all on its own! It's considered a 'luxury item', so I'm charging 25,000g. -Marnie

Ginger Island From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Ginger Island Occupants: Leo Birdie Professor Snail Island Trader Mr. Qi Ginger Island is located within the Fern Islands archipelago and is the only island in the archipelago that the player can visit. It can be accessed after repairing the boat in the back room of Willy's Fish Shop. Purchasing a ticket to ride the boat costs data-sort-value="1000">1,000g, including the return trip, and is the main way to access the island when the shop is open. The first time the player rides the boat, a cutscene triggers showing the coast of the region, including some other islands that can be seen on the way. The next time, only the animation of Willy getting on the boat and starting to steer it is shown. The boat arrives at a dock on the island with only a single path leading inland at first, as the rest of the island is closed off. The island is largely inhabited by parrots, which can be offered Golden Walnuts to unlock additional areas or features. Ginger Island is rather unique amongst the player-visitable areas of Stardew Valley because similar to the Greenhouse, the current season does not affect which crops can be planted and grown on the island, nor does the current season affect which fish can be caught there. The player can return to Stardew Valley at any time for free by entering the boat on the southern beach. They will usually arrive back inside the Fish Shop, except on festival days when the path back to the Farm is blocked, in which case the player will be deposited to the Bus Stop instead. If the festival is held on the Beach, the player will be deposited on the bridge leading to the beach south of Pelican Town.

Frog Egg From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. Frog Egg Summons a hungry frog companion. Information Source: Monsters  Crates and Barrels  Skull Cavern Treasure Rooms Adventurer's Guild Purchase Price: N/A Sell Price: data-sort-value="1000">1,000g The Frog Egg is a trinket item that can be obtained by slaying monsters or breaking crates and barrels in the Mines, Skull Cavern, or Quarry Mine. Drop chances from both methods are affected by daily luck and luck buffs, among other factors. The Burglar's Ring and Monster Compendium do not impact the chance to obtain it from monsters.[1] There is also a ~0.6% chance to obtain a Frog Egg from a treasure chest in the Skull Cavern.[2] Equipping the Frog Egg in the trinket slot causes a frog to spawn and follow the player around. When monsters are within 4-5 tiles of the frog, it will try to consume the nearest enemy by grabbing the enemy with its tongue. If unsuccessful, the frog will try again after 2 seconds. If successful, then the frog will follow the player with a full belly. After 12 seconds, the frog returns to normal size and is able to eat another enemy.[3] Note: Enemies eaten by the frog will not drop anything and do not count as kills towards quests or Monster Eradication Goals.

Cabin From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Cabin A home for a friend! Subsidized by the town agricultural fund. Information Build cost: data-sort-value="100">100g Build materials: None Size: 5x3 For cabin placement, see Cabin Locations For cabin/farmhouse storage, see Keg The Cabin is a farm building that enables the ability to house one farmhand each in a Multiplayer game. (Note that multiplayer is not available on mobile devices, so cabins are not available on mobile platforms.) They behave much like the Farmhouse, but belong to a farmhand rather than the host of the game. Up to 7 cabins can be present. They may be chosen at the start of a new co-op game, in "Nearby" or "Separate" layout, or can also be added to a saved game by visiting the Carpenter's Shop and choosing "Construct farm buildings" from the menu. If chosen at the start of a Multiplayer game, cabins are free. If built on an existing farm, the cost is data-sort-value="100">100g for each of the 7 varieties of Cabin. Cabins are built instantaneously upon purchase. A farmhand moves into a cabin by picking up the Parsnip Seeds or Hay left by Mayor Lewis on the floor of the cabin. Cabins can be demolished by the host at any time, by visiting the Carpenter's Shop (or Wizard's Tower, if the player has unlocked the magic buildings). This will permanently remove the player who occupies the cabin from the game. The player's inventory (other than tools) will appear in a chest in place of the demolished cabin. A farmhand's inventory can be accessed by the host player in a Multiplayer game by looking in Mayor Lewis' Manor in the Lost and Found box. Contents 1 Interior 2 Upgrades 3 Varieties 4

It can be purchased for data-sort-value="200">200g at Pierre's General Store and for data-sort-value="250">250g at JojaMart. Players have the ability to craft Rice from Unmilled Rice by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one Unmilled Rice will make one Rice. Unmilled Rice placed inside will appear as Rice in the box beside the Mill the next morning. The building can process an unlimited amount of rice per day. Note: Rice made using the mill is profitable; it has a higher sell price than Unmilled Rice. Using Preserves Jars would be slightly more profitable per unit of Unmilled Rice if there is sufficient capacity, as the resulting pickles would sell for 110g. However, Rice can be further processed into Vinegar with a Keg, producing two Vinegar per Rice. As Vinegar sells for 100g each, this ultimately results in more profit than using Preserves Jars.

Community Center From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Community Center Open Hours: Always Closed: Never Occupants: Junimos For Community Center Bundles, see Bundles. The Pelican Town Community Center is located in Pelican Town, on the screen north of Pierre's General Store. Initially, it appears as a dilapidated building, and is locked to the community. To open the Community Center, the player must enter Pelican Town from the Bus Stop on a day when it is not raining, from Spring 5th onward, between 8:00 am and 1:00 pm. Entering town from another direction, at another time, or on a rainy day, will not trigger the cutscene. In multiplayer, the host must trigger the cutscene. During the cutscene, Mayor Lewis unlocks the building and leads the player inside, where strange creatures called Junimos appear and quickly disappear before Lewis can see them. Lewis says he wouldn't be surprised if the place was "full of rats". The cutscene ends with Lewis informing the player that he will leave the Community Center unlocked in the future. Viewing the cut-scene unlocks the "Rat Problem" quest. To fulfill the "Rat Problem" quest, the player must re-enter the Community Center and interact with a Golden Scroll located in the lower left room. The scroll contains strange writing that can't be deciphered. The morning after reading the scroll, the player will receive a letter from the Wizard saying he has information about the "rat problem" and that the player should pay him a visit. Reading this letter unlocks the "Meet the Wizard" quest. Visiting the Wizard at his tower in the west of Cindersap Forest will trigger a cutscene during which the Wizard gives the player a potion that grants the Forest Magic power, allowing the player to read the language of the Junimos. Thereafter, all Golden Scrolls at the Community Center can be read by the player. Each scroll asks for specific offerings in the form of Bundles. Completing all the bundles restores the Community Center. Alternatively, if the player purchases a JojaMart membership from Morris for data-sort-value="5000">5,000g, the Community Center is permanently replaced with a Joja Warehouse. Instead of completing Bundles, the player will then purchase community upgrades through the Joja Community Development Form.

Keg Productivity From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search No Profession Tiller Artisan This page lists the productivity of processing Fruits, Vegetables, Coffee Beans, and Honey into Artisan Goods in a Keg. The products produced usually sell for more than the raw input items, so using a Keg is almost always profitable. Items that lose gold are highlighted in red, and items whose net increase in value is zero are highlighted in orange. The profit made from processing items is lowest when using iridium quality and highest when using regular quality items. Beer, Mead, Pale Ale, and Wine can be aged in a Cask to further increase their profit. The table below shows profit for regular quality processed items only. This table does not take into account the effects of Tiller or Artisan professions, which reduce and increase the profit from a Keg, respectively. To view the profitability for those professions, use the links at the top of the page. Note that the processing times for a Keg vary, depending on the item used. Beer = 1,750 minutes Coffee = 120 minutes Green Tea = 180 minutes Juice = 6,000 minutes Mead = 600 minutes Pale Ale = 2,250 minutes Wine = 10,000 minutes For items that take less than a day to process (e.g., Coffee), the table calculates maximum profit assuming the player continually harvests and refills the keg during a 1600 minute day. [1] Productivity (g/minute) = ([Processed Sell Price] - [Input Item Sell Price]) / Processing Time Approximate g/day = Productivity (g/minute) * 1600 [1] Note that you may click on a column header to sort the table by that column, then Shift+Click on a second column to perform a secondary sort.

Mushroom Tree From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Mushroom Tree Information Seed Mushroom Tree Seed Tapper Product Common Mushroom Red Mushroom Purple Mushroom Growth Time Variable A Mushroom Tree is a tree that can be obtained in 2 ways: A Mushroom Tree Seed can be purchased once Qi's Walnut Room is unlocked. When planted, it will grow into a Mushroom Tree. A common tree can turn into a Mushroom Tree due to to a rare event in Fall. On each day of Fall, starting on Fall 2, there is a 5% chance of a spawning event being triggered. During the event, the game engine will choose 10 farm tiles at random. If any of those 10 tiles have a fully grown, untapped common tree (or tree stump), then that tree will transform into a Mushroom Tree (or Mushroom Stump). If a mushroom stump is spawned, it will grow into a Mushroom Tree, but not until the following Spring. There are no limits on the number of times this event can occur. A Mushroom Tree can be chopped down using an axe and will drop 5-6 Red or Purple Mushrooms (plus one for the trunk). It does not yield seeds when shaken or chopped down, but it will spread seeds like a common tree. If unobstructed, seeds spread by a Mushroom Tree have a 20% chance to grow to the next stage each day during Spring, Summer, or Fall. During Winter, Mushroom Tree seeds/saplings do not grow, and fully-grown Mushroom Trees will be reduced to a stump. The following Spring, the stump will regrow to a full tree. Like common trees, the stump may spread seeds to the surrounding area. If hit by lightning, a Mushroom Tree will be reduced to a stump, leaving mushrooms behind, in the same way that common trees leave wood/sap. A Mushroom Tree can be tapped with a tapper. It yields Red Mushroom, Purple Mushroom, and Common Mushroom when tapped, except during the Winter. During Winter, the Tapper will remain on the tree, despite the tree itself being replaced by a stump. While tappers will remain on stumps, they cannot be placed on stumps during the Winter. Using a Heavy Tapper will not make the tapping faster. Contents 1 Tapper Product 2 Mushroom Cap Hat 3 Stages of Growth 4 Bugs 5 References 6

Wild winter roots do not grow above ground, but instead they are buried in the snow/dirt and must be dug up with a Hoe (no other tools, even Bombs, will work). The highest chance of finding a Winter Root (17-24%, map-dependent) is when digging up an Artifact Spot.[1] There is also a 4% chance of finding a Winter Root when digging standard tillable soil in any exterior location.[2] Exceptions are in the Farm, where Winter Roots can be found at artifact spots, but not standard tillable soil, and both the Desert and Ginger Island, where Winter Roots can not be found at all. Digging up a Winter Root provides no experience. Winter Roots can also be grown from Winter Seeds, in which case they are a standard wild-seed crop: they grow above ground, can be harvested without using a tool, give 7 Foraging XP each, and are affected by the Gatherer and Botanist professions. Occasionally they may be sold at the Traveling Cart or found in Garbage Cans in Winter. They may also be dropped by Blue Slimes (8% chance) in The Mines (floors 41-79) or Secret Woods. Putting a Winter Root in a Seed Maker will generate 1-3 Winter Seeds. Contents 1 Gifting 2 Bundles 3 Recipes 3.1 Cooking 3.2 Crafting 4 Tailoring 5 Quests 6 References 7

Wild Bait From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Wild Bait A unique recipe from Linus that gives you a chance to catch two fish at once. Information Source Crafting Energy Inedible Sell Price data-sort-value="15">15g Crafting Recipe Source Linus (4-heart event) Ingredients Fiber (10) Slime (5) Bug Meat (5) Produces 5 Wild Bait per craft Wild Bait is a type of bait that makes it possible to catch two fish at the same time. The chance of two fish being caught at once is equal to 0.25 + Daily Luck / 2.0. It also reduces the delay before a nibble on a fishing rod by 62.5%, making fish bite slightly faster than with standard bait.[1] The chance of catching 2 fish does not apply to Legendary Fish. It can however, catch 2 of the semi-Legendary fish caught from the Extended Family quest line. Wild Bait can be crafted after being taught the recipe by Linus during his 4-heart cutscene. Once the recipe is known it is also possible to obtain Wild Bait from regular Fishing Treasure Chests and Golden Fishing Treasure Chests. It can also be found in artifact spots on Ginger Island, even before triggering the cutscene with Linus. Note that catching two fish does not grant double fishing experience points. However, catching two fish while working on a fishing or special order quest counts both fish toward the required total. Wild Bait cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod, the Iridium Rod, and the Advanced Iridium Rod can use bait. Wild bait can be used in a Crab Pot, where it decreases the chance of catching trash (if the player does not have the Mariner profession) compared to using standard bait.[2] Contents 1 Use 2 Gifting 3 Bundles 4 Recipes 5 Tailoring 6 Quests 7 References 8

Stardew Valley Fair From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search The Stardew Valley Fair is a festival that takes place on Tuesday, the 16th of Fall every year. The player attends the fair by entering Pelican Town between 9am and 3pm. When the player leaves the festival, they will be returned to The Farm at 10pm. On the day of the Festival, the player cannot enter Pelican Town until 9am. Every home and shop outside the town square is "locked" and cannot be entered before or during the festival. There are several games where the player can earn Star Tokens, a currency that can be exchanged for prizes at the Shop near the entrance to the Bus Stop. The maximum number of tokens that can be held is 9,999. The purchase limit on each of the available fixed stock items is 1 (until next year when they replenish). Therefore, the maximum number of Star Tokens that may be used for the fixed stock is 4,900 (2,900 if they have already purchased the Stardrop). The Shop will be fully stocked again the following year, with the exception of the Stardrop which may be purchased only once. Star tokens do not carry over from the previous year, but the grange event can be repeated to earn more star points. The Fair also has a Grange Display contest where products of the farm can be shown to gain Star Tokens. Talk to Mayor Lewis when ready to have the products judged. All of the Grange Display items can be picked up after judging, but they will not be automatically returned to the inventory. If the player leaves the items behind in the Grange Display, as of version 1.5, they can retrieve them later in the Lost and Found. North of the fair by the fountains, Gus can be found cooking Survival Burgers, which the player can eat to refill their energy bar, but this won't be noticeable until exiting the festival.

Shipping From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search This article is primarily about the game mechanic. For the placeable object, see Farm Buildings.  If you have anything to sell, just place it in this box here. I'll come by during the night to collect it.  Lewis Shipping allows the player to sell items by placing them into a Shipping Bin or Mini-Shipping Bin. Gold is received after going to sleep for the night. Iridium quality items have the highest value, followed by gold, silver, and regular quality items, in that order. The amount of gold received from shipping is the same as when selling to a merchant. The main difference is that merchants will pay immediately, while the gold received from shipping is given the next day. Also, not all items can be sold using both methods: some items can be sold using only the shipping bin; other items that cannot be placed in the shipping bin can be sold to merchants (notably, weapons can be sold to the Adventurer's Guild). Items sold to merchants are not included in the statistics on the Collection tab and do not count towards shipping-specific Achievements. The player must ship one of every item to achieve 100% perfection. The shipping bin opens its lid when the player approaches it. To ship an item (or stack of items), approach the shipping bin and "use" it (right-click on it), then left-click on the item in inventory. Alternatively, select an item in inventory, approach the shipping bin, and left-click on the bin. If a mistake is made and the wrong item is put in the shipping bin, "use" the bin at any time during the same day to display the last item. Click on that item to add it back into inventory. Only the last item shipped can be retrieved. Contents 1 Construction 2 Collection 3 Achievements 3.1 Polyculture 3.2 Monoculture 3.3 Full Shipment 4

Normally, they wear out and disappear after 20 nibbles by fish (indicated by "HIT" popping up on screen). Tackle does not wear out when catching junk items, specifically when catching Green Algae, White Algae, Seaweed, Sea Jelly, River Jelly, Cave Jelly, or Trash. Only the Iridium Rod or the Advanced Iridium Rod can equip tackle. The Iridium Rod can only attach one tackle at a time, while the Advanced Iridium Rod can attach two. To attach tackle, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle. For an Advanced Iridium Rod, the left tackle will be the first one removed. Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.

Help:Editing From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Hello and welcome to the wiki! We want you to enjoy your time here. In that spirit, the following is a list of "do" and "don't" activities that we hope will be helpful. Most of the items are based on common sources of confusion or error that have been encountered most frequently. Please note this is not an exhaustive list of rules, but an effort to convey the general practices and conventions used on the Stardew Valley official wiki. Contents 1 What is the Stardew Valley Wiki? 2 New Editor Restriction 3 Protected Pages 4 Discussion Pages 5 Editing 5.1 Writing Style 5.2 Major vs. Minor Edits 6 Formatting 7 Version 1.6 7.1 Editing & Formatting 8 Images 9 Bugs 10 Translations 11 Templates 12 More Info What is the Stardew Valley Wiki? This is the online encyclopedia of the game, not the social area. For social interactions and general gameplay questions, use the official forums, subreddit, or discord server. This is not wikipedia. Wikipedia conventions and rules may or may not apply. This is not any other game's wiki. Other game wikis' standards and conventions probably don't apply either. Please do not use the wiki (including your user page) to keep track of your personal game progress. The administrative staff of the Stardew Valley Wiki is small, and they do not want to review multiple edits for every milestone you've achieved in-game. New Editor Restriction Newly created accounts cannot make large edits or add hyperlinks. This is to combat spam and vandalism. If you're trying to make a large edit and encountering this problem, make a series of smaller edits, saving in-between, until you are no longer considered a new user. It's a good idea to save large changes to a text file on your computer, so your work isn't lost in case of problems. Protected Pages Some pages are protected from editing. These pages have a "View source" link at the top instead of an "Edit" link. You can make suggestions for corrections to protected pages indirectly, by clicking on the "Discussion" link at the top and making a comment. Discussion Pages Also known as "talk pages", these can be reached by clicking the "Discussion" link at the top of the page. Discussion pages are the place to propose large-scale changes to content or formatting, or to ask questions. Please sign your comments on discussion pages by typing 4 tildes ~~~~. These will automatically add your signature and a date/time stamp to the comment. Editing Use the Show preview button before saving edits. Look for redlinks, formatting glitches, missing table cells, etc. and fix them before saving the edit. Provide a code reference when removing or changing existing information. (For more information about formatting references, see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Cite.) Discuss large scale changes before making them. Large changes to the English wiki must be carried out in 11 other languages. The time and effort required to implement the changes must be taken into account before the changes are made. For new pages that lack complete information, especially those related to new content, it's a good idea to place {{Stub}} at the top of the page.

Defense From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Defense is a statistic that affects how much damage the player takes. Defense can be increased by food and equipment, or decreased by debuffs. Each point of total Defense reduces damage taken by 1 point, to a minimum of 1 damage per hit. For example, a Green Slime normally deals between 4 and 6 damage. If Sneakers are equipped, providing 1 Defense, it deals between 3 and 5 damage instead. On the other hand, if Space Boots are equipped, providing 4 Defense, a Green Slime deals 1 damage 66% of the time and 2 damage 33% of the time. Negative Defense increases damage taken. For example, the Shadow Shaman Jinxed effect causes damage from each hit to be increased by 8. Contents 1 Food 2 Events 3 Equipment 3.1 Weapons 3.2 Rings 3.3 Footwear 4 Permanent Buffs 5

Some crops, such as kale and wheat, need to be harvested with the scythe. ...This is a book by Marnie. 'Animals are very sensitive. They like to be pet every day, and prefer to eat grass outdoors than dry hay. They don't like being outside in the rain, though. Happy animals produce higher quality products!' On Foraging The local woods and mountains are great places to find wild produce! A good forager will clear out any weeds, stumps, or stones from these areas, so the wild produce has plenty of space to grow! Expert foragers know the secret to cultivating wild food so that it can be grown on the farm. Isn't that amazing? The Fisherman, Act I Tex: Gordy, how do you catch so many fish? For me, it takes forever! Gordy: You must take the choice to become a true fisherman... and over time your fishing speed will increase! Tex: So you're saying that improving my fishing skill will make me fish faster? Gordy: Correct. One day you may even learn the secret to creating your very own bobbers, improving your mastery even more. Now, begone! How deep do the mines go? This question has been pondered by many Stardew Valley explorers over the years... The truth is, no one really knows. Or at least, they aren't telling anyone. Unfortunately, many of those who venture deep into the mines never return... However, there have been a few bold adventurers who have traveled deep into the mines, and have resurfaced with interesting reports. Apparently, there are three distinct areas in the mine, each with unique monsters and treasures. Some adventurers speak of gigantic underground lakes and strange creatures... But none of these claims have been proven. An Old Farmer's Journal I've been here for a year now, and I've started to make friends with the local townspeople. It sure feels great! And they're sending me gifts and secret family recipes in the mail, too! That's really helpful. Scarecrows Once you start growing a lot of crops on your farm, you can expect to be visited by crows. In the morning, you might discover that a crow has made breakfast out of your hard work! One way to prevent those bothersome crows from eating your crops is to set up scarecrows near your crops. Be aware that scarecrows have limited range, so you'll need multiple if your farm is large. Scarecrows keep track of how many crows they've diverted. You can use that to tell they're in a useful spot. 'Collectible Scarecrows' aren't just for looks! They work just the same as the regular model. The Secret of the Stardrop For thousands of years, people have been intrigued by the mysterious powers from the stardrop... but no one knows where they come from! Professor R. J. Kutler, a leading researcher on strange fruit, says this: "We've discovered traces of genetic material on meteorites that closely resemble the Stardrop, but it's not a proven match". Regardless of where they come from, the peculiar fruit is said to be uncommonly delicious... and some even claim they grant special power to those who eat them. Journey of the Prairie King -- The Smash Hit Video Game! Did you know? Anyone who beats 'Journey of the Prairie King' is automatically entered into a drawing for a special prize? Did you know? The developer has stated that the protagonist is based on a real-life character... A true cowboy hero from the prairie-island in the Gem Sea! A Study on Diamond Yields After years of research in the mines, I believe I've learned something about diamond frequency. My research involved only the stones that are scattered about the mines... The ones that are broken with a pickaxe. Mineral yields from other sources require more research. Diamonds seem to only form at mine level 50 or greater. At level 50, approximately 1 in 500 stones will be diamond-rich. After level 50, the frequency of diamond formation seems to increase by about .000016 per level. Quite a rare gem! -M. Jasper Brewmaster's Guide Ah... to brew! The rich smell of yeast wafting through a cedar loft... The floral overtones of freshly cut hops on a winter's eve... but I digress. You are probably more interested in the practical side of brewing... To brew, you will need a keg. I'll leave it up to you to devise blueprints for a keg. Kegs can be used to make several kinds of product. If vegetables are placed inside, the keg will produce juice. Juice takes the least amount of time to brew. If wheat is placed in the keg, it will produce beer. Beer takes a while to brew, but it is quite profitable. Placing hops in a keg will produced the beloved 'Pale Ale' Place fruit in the keg to make wine. Wine takes the longest of all to make, but a wine made from the finest fruit is worth quite a bit! Be patient with your keg... you'll know it's finished when it's perfectly still. And only drink in moderation, or you'll surely regret it! Mysteries of the Dwarves The Dwarves call themselves 'Smoluanu'... which translates to 'sky people'. An odd name for a group that lives deep underground, isn't it? Another mystery of the dwarves is the advanced technology they supposedly possess. Evidence such as this had led me, despite the ridicule of my colleagues, to propose a new theory: I believe the dwarves are the remnants of a once advanced civilization whos interplanetary vehicle crashed on this planet long ago. I propose that this dwarvish spaceship bore down, deep underground... and over time, the dwarves became adapted to their new underground environment. My colleagues ask, 'Why didn't they come above ground and live on the surface?' ...Perhaps their old planet had a thicker atmosphere that protected them from stellar radiation, and they simply could not survive in our sunlight. That would explain why they only surface at night to take what they need from our houses... -M. Jasper Highlights From The Book of Yoba Before time there was only the endless golden light. The light called out to itself...'Yoba'. Yoba wanted more. Yoba swirled the golden light into a vortex. Yoba swirled and swirled until a hole formed in the eye of the vortex. From this hole sprung a seed. Yoba smoothed the golden light. Yoba smoothed and smoothed, and the light became soil. Into this soil, Yoba planted the seed. The seed sprouted, and behold! A vine sprung skyward, twisting and probing, casting a writhing shadow onto the golden void. After 11 days, the vine bore fruit. Yoba, with knowing wisdom, peeled the tough skin off the fruit and saw that the world was inside. And so that is how the world came to be. Marriage Guide for Farmers Before you ask someone to marry you, you'll have to date them for a while first (Ask someone to date you with a bouquet from Pierre's). When you're ready to pop the big question, you'll need to give them a 'Mermaid's Pendant'. Everyone knows what it means when you present them with one of those. It's rumored that on stormy days, the ghost of an old mariner appears in Stardew Valley, clutching just such a pendant. After the wedding ceremony, your partner will move in with you. Remember to treat your spouse well... They still like gifts even after marriage! (Paid for by Pierre) The Fisherman, Act II Tex: Gordy, tell me your best fisherman's story. Gordy: -deep sigh-... I've caught a lot of big fish in my time... And some that are very rare and difficult... But there was one that I struggled to catch for three days and three nights. Gordy: I call this fish... 'The Legend'. He was a huge beast... And the harder I tugged on the line, the harder he tugged back. I let my guard down for a moment and he snapped my boat in two. I've never fished since. Tex: Do you think anyone will ever catch him? Gordy: Hmm... If this person were a master at fishing, and caught all other rare fish first, and made sure they ate the correct kind of food... then maybe. Above all you've got to have respect for the water, son. Tex: ...son? Do you mean... you're... f...father? Gordy: Yes, my boy. --Dramatic Music as the curtains fall-- Technology Report! The blueprints for an advanced piece of machinery called a 'Crystalarium' have recently been published. This machine can grow crystals from almost nothing, providing their owners with endless supplies of valuable gems! Here's how it works: Place a gem of your choice inside the crystalarium... now be patient, it can take up to several days... but eventually the crystalarium will grow a copy of whatever you placed inside! You'll know it's ready when it stops wiggling. Once you remove your gem the crystalarium will start working on yet another clone... You'll never need to restock it unless you want to change the kind of gem it produces! Unfortunately, the crystalarium doesn't work with the extremely rare gemstone known as 'Prismatic Shard'... For some reason, the EMF from the shard interacts negatively with the crystalarium. Secrets of the Legendary Fish Fisherman speak of five rare and unique fish that can only be caught by skilled anglers. Once caught, they will never appear again. The Crimsonfish lives in the warm ocean waters of summer. It's been sighted on the far eastern side of the beach. The Glacierfish, which only appears in winter, can be caught off the southern tip of arrowhead island in Cindersap Forest... near where the river meets the ocean. The Anglerfish has been spotted in fall, north of town where the river flows down from the mountains. There's rumor of a strange, twisted fish that lives in the sewer. The final fish, of a species never before caught, is known simply as 'Legend'. It is rumored that he lives in a log submerged in the mountain lake, and only ventures out on rainy spring days to nibble at the frog's eggs. Only the most skilled fisherman can hope to catch this one. Train at fishing and be persistent, and eventually you will catch these elusive fish. Make sure to respect the water and don't remove too many fish from the ecosystem. N/A ...Saw something weird in the tunnel leading out from Pelican Town. There's a little door hidden in the dark. Couldn't get it open, though. -Gunther Note From Gunther Wow, this library has really become great, thanks to your help! Thanks a bunch! Goblins by M. Jasper The species commonly known as "Goblin" seems to have originated in the forests of the far northeast, beyond the Bluemire Hills. Characterized by their green skin, bright red eyes, and foul smell, initial encounters with Goblins can be frightening for unexperienced travellers. Despite their unsettling appearance, Goblins possess an intellectual and emotional capacity akin to humans, and have no trouble learning our customs and languages. The goblins I've met have been rather friendly and amiable, once I've shown that I mean no harm. Unfortunately, centuries of distrust and ill-treatment from humans has led many Goblins to pursue careers in the employment of witches, warlocks, necromancers, and other unsavory types. A traditional Goblin diet consists of grub meat, typically from the large and juicy grub varieties native to the Goblin home-forest. On special occasions, Goblins will indulge in an item called 'void mayonnaise'... considered perhaps the finest delicacy in all Goblin cuisine.

It can be obtained by fishing in the ocean from the southernmost point of Cindersap Forest near the entrance to The Sewers. A minimum effective Fishing level of 15 is required to achieve the long cast distance required to reach the ocean from Cindersap Forest. This can be achieved by reaching level 10 Fishing, consuming gold-quality Seafoam Pudding cooked with Qi Seasoning, and maximizing the casting meter of a rod. Another alternative is to consume regular-quality Seafoam Pudding (or consume a gold-quality food item that normally gives +3 Fishing) and use a rod enchanted with the Master enchantment at the Forge. The first time fishing there will always result in obtaining the statue. Only one statue can be obtained per player per game.[1] Location Glitch Iridium Krobus can be more easily obtained by using the sword-swing glitch to glitch out of the map and stand closer to the ocean.

Behavior They disguise themselves as stones, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack, though they can be hit with a pickaxe to knock them back, making them mobile again. Strategy Lava Crabs may be differentiated from rocks by striking them with a weapon. A Lava Crab will make a knocking sound and a zero damage indicator will pop up when hit with a weapon, while a rock will not. The Lava Crab can only be dealt damage if it is mobile, and not hiding beneath its shell. Strike an immobile Lava Crab with a pickaxe to make it mobile again. Striking a Lava Crab with a pickaxe enough times will knock the shell off of its back, and will cause it to flee. Alternatively, setting off a bomb near a Lava Crab can remove its shell, and will cause it to flee as well.

Crafting From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. For food items prepared in the kitchen, see Cooking. Crafting is the activity of creating a new item as specified by a crafting recipe. Similar to but separate from Cooking, each recipe lists a set of ingredient items that are consumed in each crafting action. The player knows ten crafting recipes at the start of the game, and must learn all others by gaining skills, developing friendships with townsfolk, and purchasing the rest from shops. Unlike cooked items, most (not all) crafted items are inedible. The Crafting menu can be accessed by pausing the game (using E/ESC on PC, on Switch, on Xbox, on PlayStation) and navigating to the tab with a hammer icon. The recipes the player knows will be saturated, while recipes with missing ingredients are faded grey. By mousing over each item, a popup shows the materials that you will need. Ingredient names written in red text are not currently in the player's inventory. To craft an item, click on the item's icon once you have all the required ingredients. The newly crafted item will appear beneath the player's cursor, and the player can then place it inside their inventory. The crafting screen may expand to multiple pages once the player acquires a larger selection of recipes. Crafting recipes are gained by leveling up any skills, purchased from merchants, or received as gifts by gaining friendship points with villagers.

Vegetables From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Vegetable is the category used for many of the Crops grown on the farm. One foraged item, Fiddlehead Fern, is also considered to be a vegetable. Other foraged items that are real-life vegetables (e.g., Leeks, Spring Onions) are categorized as Forage instead of Vegetable and therefore are not included here. All vegetables share several in-game characteristics. Their sell prices are increased by 10% if the player has the Tiller profession. They can be placed in a Preserves Jar to make Pickles. They can be placed in a Keg. In most cases, the product is Juice, except: Wheat produces Beer, Hops produce Pale Ale and Tea Leaves produce Green Tea. Vegetables (other than Hops, Tea Leaves, Unmilled Rice, and Wheat) are a universally liked gift; all villagers other than Abigail, Haley, Jas, Sam, and Vincent like them. There are various individual exceptions, however, as detailed at Universal Likes exceptions, and on the individual vegetable and villager pages. Vegetables are one category used when scoring items in the Grange Display at the Stardew Valley Fair. They can be sold at the General Store (as well as in the Shipping Bin). All shipped vegetables are added to the Items Shipped page of the Collections tab. The following tables lists all vegetables, where to obtain them, how much they sell for, and the prices of the artisan goods produced using a Preserves Jar or Keg.

Saves From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search For information about how the game saves progress on mobile devices, see Mobile Saves. The game saves progress when the in-game day ends, i.e., when the farmer goes to bed, collapses from exhaustion, or collapses at 2am. All progress during a day is lost if the player quits the game without ending the day. In multiplayer, the game saves after all players click through the prompts at end of day and wake up in the morning. Save files are tagged with the version of the game that last saved the file (e.g., <gameVersion>1.6</gameVersion>). An older version of the game is not able to load a newer save file, but a newer version can load an older save. Once a newer version saves over an older save file (e.g., when you save for the first time after the game itself was updated to a new version), the save file will be tagged with the newer version number. A save file may be transferred to a different device family (e.g., from mobile to PC) as long as the game version on the receiving device is not older than the save file's version tag. For example, a save file from a mobile device running version 1.4 can be transferred to and used on a PC running 1.6, but a 1.6 PC save file will not run on a mobile device with version 1.4.

They're stored separately from your game, so you can safely reinstall or update the game without losing them. On PC, they're shared between different copies of the game (e.g., if you buy it from both GOG and Steam). Each save has a folder like JonSnow_123456789, with two main files inside it: JonSnow_123456789 and SaveGameInfo. Both files are needed to load the save.

PC/Android to Switch Place the PC/Android saves folder in a zip in sd:/JKSV/Stardew Valley/. Open JKSV and navigate to Stardew Valley. It is advised to create a backup (above) before the next step. Press Y on the save you just copied over and hold A. Troubleshooting Save disappeared or doesn't load Here's how to recover your save in most cases. (Note that save issues are almost always caused by the game itself, not mods.) Find your save files. If the files are still there, here are some common fixes (try one at a time): If some of the files have _STARDEWVALLEYSAVETMP in the name, remove that from their name and reload the game. You may need to first disable Steam cloud saves for SDV, as it can keep automatically renaming them every time you reload. To do that, go to Stardew Valley in your Steam library, click the gear icon and go to Properties, and uncheck the option to sync cloud saves. If you recently renamed or created the folder (e.g., to restore a backup), make sure the folder name exactly matches the file that looks like FarmName_0123456789. Try undoing the last save. If you are on PC, ensure that the game files do not have an extension like .bin. If you are on Android, you may need to add the file extension .bin. Modded saves may not be able to load in the vanilla game, depending on the mods that were used. If you previously played with mods but are trying to launch the game in vanilla, try reinstalling SMAPI and playing a day. SMAPI will automatically clean up any custom content from your save. Note that if you still have custom items in your inventory, they will turn into blank error items and may cause issues. If the files are missing but you have SMAPI installed, see restore a backup by SMAPI. If the files are there but newer game progress is missing, it's possible Steam Cloud Sync / GOG Galaxy / mobile equivalent automatically replaced your save with the version it had stored. To solve: Launch the game. (Don't load a save yet.) While the game is still running, delete your save folder and put your backup back in. Load the save. The cloud backup service will detect that the save changed while the game was running, so it'll treat that as the new version to save. If the above fixes didn't help, see this guide or ask for help; we might be able to recover the save for you. Note: don't keep backup folders in the saves folder, since the game will try to load them. Either move those into a different folder, or delete them. Undo the last save If something went wrong, you can undo the last save. For a save from Linux/Mac/Windows/Android: Find your save files. You should see two files with an _old suffix in the name; if not, ask for help instead! Back up your save folder just in case. Delete SaveGameInfo and the file that looks like FarmName_123456789. Remove the _old suffix from SaveGameInfo_old and the file that looks like FarmName_123456789_old. For a save from iOS: Find your save files. You should see a file with an _SVBAK suffix in the name; if not, ask for help instead! Back up your save folder just in case. Delete the files that look like YourName_123456789 and YourName_123456789_SVEMERG. Remove the _SVBAK suffix from the file that looks like YourName_123456789_SVBAK. Restore a backup by SMAPI If you use the SMAPI modding API, the bundled SaveBackup mod keeps up to 10 daily backups of your saves. Even if the original save was completely deleted or corrupted, you can probably recover it from SMAPI's backup. To restore a save backup: Find your game folder. Open the save-backups subfolder. Unzip (or 'extract') the latest backup which has your save. Copy the save folder back into your Saves folder. Advanced Edit a save A save file open in Sublime Text with formatted XML. You can edit your save to fix some common issues or change your choices. This can permanently break your save if you make a mistake; don't forget to create a backup first. You should also avoid automatic save editor tools, since they often break the save. Install Sublime Text for Linux, Mac, or Windows. (If you already have another text editor which supports XML formatting, feel free to use that instead.) Install the Package Control extension for Sublime Text. Use the Package Control extension to install the Indent XML and XPath plugins (see how to add plugins). Make a backup of your save file just in case something goes wrong. Open your save file (the file that looks like Name_0123456789) in Sublime Text. Click Selection > Format > Indent XML. Make any changes you want and save. (See the sections below, this guide for changing the host of a co-op save, and this guide for other changes.) Tips: Click an element, and press CTRL + SHIFT + [ to collapse the whole section which contains it. This is useful when you want to ignore a large field. For example, given this text in the save file: <ArrayOfInt>
<int>1981</int>
<int>0</int>
<int>0</int>
<int>0</int>
<int>0</int>
<int>0</int>
</ArrayOfInt>
Click on one of the <int> fields and press those keys, and it will collapse into this: <ArrayOfInt> []
</ArrayOfInt>
Click any element, and look in the status bar to see the path to where you are in the save format (like /SaveGame/player/friendships/item[32]). Duplicate a save You can duplicate a save for testing purposes, or to explore different options without starting over. Find your save files. Create the new save folder: Duplicate the target save folder. Rename the new folder: change the name so you can recognize it in-game; change the number at the end to any number that's not used by another save. Open the new folder for the next steps. Prepare the new files: Delete (or apply the following steps to, if you want the backup as well) any file whose name ends with _old or .back.*. Rename the file that looks like Name_0123456789 to match your new folder name. Edit the save metadata: Open the SaveGameInfo file in a text editor like Notepad. Look for <name> on the first line. Your farmer's name should be right after that. Change it to your new name. Search for the 2nd mention of your name (ctrl+f to 'find') and change it to your new name. Edit the save file: Open the file that looks like Name_0123456789 in a text editor like Notepad. Look for <name> on the first line. Your farmer's name should be right after that. Change it to your new name. Search for the 2nd mention of your name (ctrl+f to 'find') and change it to your new name. Search for the old save ID (<uniqueIDForThisGame>, the number from the old filename). Change it to your new number. That's it! Launch the game and check the load menu; you'll see both saves now. Change farm type If you use SMAPI (mods): You can change farm type by loading your save in-game, then entering set_farm_type FARM_ID_HERE in the SMAPI console window. (You can enter set_farm_type list to see a list of farm type IDs.) That will change the farm map, but everything placed on the farm will stay where it is. You may have things in an invalid position, like trees in a lake. You can either install Noclip Mode to reach things that are out of bounds, or run one of these console commands: command effect world_clear farm debris remove stones, branches, weeds, and dead crops. world_clear farm trees remove non-fruit trees. world_clear farm fruit-trees remove fruit trees. world_clear farm grass remove tall grass. world_clear farm everything remove everything, including placed objects. If you play without mods: You can change farm type by editing your save file: Open your save file for editing. Search for <whichFarm>. The number after that open tag is the farm type. Change the number to the one you want: Code Farm Type 0 Standard Farm 1 Riverland Farm 2 Forest Farm 3 Hilltop Farm 4 Wilderness Farm 5 Four Corners Farm 6 Beach Farm 7 Meadowlands Farm That will change the farm map, but everything placed on the farm will stay where it is. You may have things in an invalid position, like trees in a lake. You can take note of what's out of bounds, then switch back to the old farm type and move them. Remove an NPC You can remove an NPC from your save file (e.g., to fix an NPC permanently stuck in an invalid place). If it still exists in the game data, the NPC will respawn when you reload the save file. This should be a last resort, and usually isn't needed when using SMAPI since it'll remove invalid NPCs automatically. Open your save file for editing. Make sure you format the file for readability per those instructions. Remove the NPC: Search for the NPC's default name between 'name' tags (e.g., to remove Penny: <name>Penny</name>). Remove the entire 'NPC' section containing the line you found, starting from the previous <NPC> line up to and including the next </NPC> line. (optional) Remove the NPC friendship data: Search for the NPC's default name between 'string' tags (e.g., to remove Penny: <string>Penny</string>). Remove the entire 'item' section containing the line you found, starting from the previous <item> line up to the next </item> line.

If successfully cut a Blue Grass, will produce two pieces of hay, instead of the usual one. Note that although Grass can also be cleared using any Weapon or Bomb, no Hay is produced in these cases. All Hay harvested from Grass is immediately placed directly into the farm's Silos. When harvesting Wheat using either scythe there is a 40% chance that each harvested Wheat will drop one unit of Hay, which in this case added to the player's inventory (or the Junimo Hut storage, if harvested by Junimos). Hay from Wheat does not go directly into Silos. Hay may also be obtained by cutting weeds with a weapon with the Haymaker enchantment, which gives a 1/3 chance for each cut weed to produce a Hay. Hay obtained this way goes directly into Silos if cut on the farm, and into the player's inventory if outside of the farm. Each Silo can store up to 240 pieces of Hay. Hay stored in Silos can only be withdrawn using the Hoppers found in Coops and Barns. When right-clicked, a Hopper will dispense Hay equal to the number of animals living in the building  but no more than the number of empty slots in the building's Feeding Bench. Therefore, it becomes impossible to withdraw Hay from a Hopper in deluxe Coops and Barns where the autofeeder always keeps the feeding bench full (see Tip). Right-clicking on a Hopper if Hay is the active item in the player's inventory will transfer the entire stack of Hay into the Silos. Once retrieved from the hopper, hay can be transferred to chests for storage from the inventory, bypassing the need for multiple silos. Hay can be purchased, either from Marnie's Ranch for data-sort-value="50">50g or from the Desert Trader who sells 3 Hay in exchange for 1 Omni Geode on Mondays. Marnie may randomly send the player 30 Hay in the mail. Marnie also sells Hay at her Desert Festival shop for data-sort-value="1"> 1 Calico Egg. Fifteen pieces of hay are provided by Mayor Lewis at the start of the game if the player has chosen the Meadowlands Farm. Contents 1 Feeding Animals 2 Gifting 3 Quests 4 Bundles 5 Tailoring 6 Tip 7

Mini-Fridge From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Mini-Fridge Allows you to store additional ingredients for cooking. Information Source Carpenter's Shop for data-sort-value="3000">3,000g "Gus' Famous Omelet" Special Order Sell Price Cannot be sold The Mini-Fridge allows players to expand their Refrigerator storage used for cooking. It's sold at the Carpenter's Shop for data-sort-value="3000">3,000g after upgrading the farmhouse or received in the mail after completing "Gus' Famous Omelet" Special Order. Similar to how a regular Refrigerator works inside the Farmhouse, adding cooking ingredients to the Mini-Fridge allows players to cook food using any stored ingredients as if they were stored in inventory. There are 36 inventory slots inside. The Mini-Fridge can be placed only inside the farmhouse, not including the cellar. It cannot be placed if obtained before the upgraded farmhouse. The Mini-Fridge can also be placed in the farmhouse on Ginger Island. Notes Every recipe searches for ingredients in the following locations, always in the same order from the bottom right slot to the top left slot: first in the player's inventory then in the main refrigerator finally in any Mini-Fridges When auto-sorted with the Organize button, this bottom-right-first order will automatically consume lower quality items of the same type. However, for recipes with substitutes, place ingredients accordingly as desired towards the bottom right, in order to avoid using more valuable ingredients in less valuable recipes, or in recipes that accept a wide variety of ingredients. As an example, Tuna (which is required for Fish Taco) is accepted in Sashimi which accepts any type of fish. However, by placing a Mussel in the bottom right slot, the Mussel will be picked first and save the Tuna for the more exclusive and valuable recipe. When searching multiple Mini-Fridges, the game picks from the last placed one in the exact chronological order in which the fridges were first placed, and then works backwards. The location of the fridge in the farmhouse does not matter.

Prismatic Jelly From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Prismatic Jelly Harvested from the rare and elusive prismatic slime. Information Source Prismatic Slimes (100% drop) Sell Price Cannot be sold Prismatic Jelly will always drop from killing non-special Prismatic Slimes. They are only obtainable while the Wizard's "Prismatic Jelly" Special Order quest is active. Only one Prismatic Jelly is required for the Special Order, and any not handed to the Wizard will disappear once the order is complete or expired. While the special order is active, each slime spawned in The Mines, Quarry Mine, or Skull Cavern has a 1.2% chance to be replaced with a Prismatic Slime, depending on daily luck. The exact chance is 0.012 + Daily Luck / 10.0 [1]. However, the chance cannot drop below 0.01. Trivia It is possible for a Prismatic Slime to be a special slime. In this case, the Prismatic Slime will only drop one of the special items and will not drop the intended Prismatic Jelly. PC only: Prismatic Jelly can be spawned using the item ID glitch and gifted as a universally hated gift. When killing a Prismatic Slime while wearing the Burglar's Ring, the slime will drop two Prismatic Jellies. Since the Quarry Mine is reset at the end of the day, instead of when leaving the floor like in the Mines or Skull Cavern, a prismatic slime spawned there will persist for the entire day. If the player passes out from low health, the Quarry Mine can be revisited for another chance to kill the prismatic slime. References ? See Locations.MineShaft::populateLevel in the game code.

Children From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search You can have children only if you are married and have upgraded the Farmhouse for the second time which adds a nursery and an extra room. After you go to bed for the night, your spouse might ask (1/20 chance) if you want to have/adopt a child. You can answer "yes" or "not now." Same-gender couples will adopt children, and opposite-gender couples will have biological children. If you remove the crib via a house renovation, you cannot have new children (whether adoptive or biological) unless the crib is replaced. You can have only two children: one male and one female. The gender of the first child is random, and the gender of the second child is the opposite of the first child. Children never grow up past the Toddler stage (Stage 4). You will have the option to acquire a second child only after the first child has grown to the Toddler stage. Your spouse will also take your children when they're at least in the toddler stage to events such as the Stardew Valley Fair where they can be found walking around your spouse. There is also a glitch causing them to appear on the same tile and overlap.

Tiller Profession Details Internally, the game tracks whether fruit came from a foraging or non-foraging source, and uses this internal information to determine whether or not the fruit should get the +10% Tiller profession bonus when sold.[1] Sources that are considered to be foraging are: Wild-grown fruit that randomly spawns throughout Stardew Valley, as detailed at Foraged Items and Spawning Fruit grown from any of the four varieties of Wild Seeds All fruit found in the Farm Cave -- including Fruit Tree fruit that otherwise is not considered to be foraged All other sources are considered to be non-foraging, including (but not limited to): Fruit grown from standard seeds (e.g., Grapes from Grape Starter) Fruit collected from trees Fruit sent in the mail as a gift Fruit purchased from the Oasis Blackberries and Salmonberries harvested from bushes If the player has both foraged and non-foraged fruit of the same quality, stacking the items together always results in non-foraged fruit: the Tiller bonus will apply to the entire stack of fruit.[2] References ? The tiller bonus does not apply to fruit where the isSpawnedObject flag is set, see code in Object::getPriceAfterMultipliers. This flag is added to wild foraged items in GameLocation::dropObject and GameLocation:spawnObjects; to crops grown from wild seeds in Crop::newDay; and, to Farm Cave fruit in FarmCave::dayUpdate. Other sources do not get the flag, including notably berries from bushes in Bush::shake. ? The code in Object:addToStack was changed in v1.4 to ensure isSpawnedObject is set to false whenever two mixed stacks are combined, i.e., that the Tiller bonus applies if either stack originally had it. Note that this code change will not retroactively fix data in games started pre-v1.4, where the Tiller bonus could be lost depending upon how stacks were combined.

Getting Started From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Getting Started The Player Options Controls Mobile Controls Health Energy Skills Day Cycle Stardew Valley is an open-ended game, allowing the player to achieve goals non-linearly. There are various ways to earn income and many activities to choose from including farming, fishing, foraging, mining, combat (fighting enemies), crafting, cooking, gift giving, completing quests, donating to the Museum and restoring the Community Center. Contents 1 Character Creation 2 Farm map 3 Controls 4 Preparing Your First Harvest 4.1 Watering Can 5 Energy 6 Skills 7 Villagers and Friendship 8 Television Character Creation Main article: The Player The character creation screen allows customization options, such as character Appearance, Gender, Name, Farm Name, Favorite Thing, and Animal Preference. There are 2 genders, 24 skin tones, 74 hairstyles, 112 shirts, 4 pants, 31 accessories, and 10 animals (5 cats and 5 dogs) to choose from. The villagers will refer to you matching the case you put your name in - for example, if you put all lowercase, the first letter will not be corrected to uppercase. {confirmed on mobile iOS and Nintendo Switch} The sliders next to eye color, hair color, and pants color represent hue, saturation, and value. Animal Preference determines which pet will arrive on the farm later. Gender does not affect in-game marriage. The "Favorite Thing" will be referenced in-game when the player eats a Stardrop. If the player chooses ConcernedApe (Capital C and A) as their favorite thing, the following message will appear when eaten. If the player puts anything containing Stardew (capital S), then the following message will appear. Players can later change their appearance for data-sort-value="500">500g, in the Wizard's Tower, after reaching 4 Hearts of friendship with him or gaining access to the Witch's Hut and using the portal within. At the character creation menu, there is a button with a wrench icon that contains all of the Advanced Options, which are: Changing the community center bundles between normal and remixed Making it so the Community Center is completable in year one by guaranteeing that the Traveling Cart will sell a Red Cabbage Seed sometime in the first year Changing the chest rewards in The Mines between normal and remixed Making it so monsters can spawn on the farm Changing the profit margin Choosing how many starter cabins there are and how far apart they are Setting the randomization in the game from the new randomization system to the old one Farm map Main article: Farm Maps Players can select from seven different farm maps. Each map offers unique benefits, and favors specific skills. After selecting a map, it cannot be changed, characters are permanently tied to their map type once created. Space-wise each map takes up the same area, but there are different amounts of usable/farmable/buildable land on each. Name Description Favored Skill Standard Farm The original farm map, designed to maximize open space for crops and animals. Farming Forest Farm The forest encroaches on the land, limiting farming space. However, there are renewable stumps on the west edge of the map, and seasonal forage items spawn there as well. There is a type of weed which spawns on this farm, which looks unique and will always drop mixed seeds when cut. Foraging Hill-top Farm Lots of cliffs and there is a special mining area in the southwest where ore will spawn, as well as unique geode-bearing stones. Mining Riverland Farm Lots of water on this map... limiting space for crops and animals. Looks nice and fishing is actually viable on this farm... In fact, players can catch the same fish that are available in town. Fishing Wilderness Farm A large lake in the southwest corner, and a cliff along the east and south. Monsters will come out at night. Their stats scale with player combat level. Wilderness Golems are unique to this map. Combat Four Corners Farm The land is divided into four parcels, each with its own perk. Perfect for a group! Multiplayer Beach Farm Good fishing and foraging, and tons of open space. Sometimes, supply crates wash up on shore. However, sprinklers don't work in the sandy soil. Seems more tailored to players who won't rely as much on crops. Foraging Fishing Meadowlands Farm A varied map, containing a river and two small lakes. Starts with a Coop and two Chickens. Chewy blue grass grows on the map, providing an improved source for food for your animals. Encourages farming, specifically raising animals. Farming Controls Main article: Controls All hotkeys can be reassigned by opening the menu and choosing the Options tab Key Description W A S D W Move Up A Move Left S Move Down D Move Right , C Use tool or place item , X Check/Do Action Escape, E Open Menu F Open Journal M Open Map window Y Open Emote Menu Switch Item Tab Shift Toolbar Left Shift Run ?, T Open Chat Box 1 - 0, - , = Inventory hotkeys F4 Screenshot mode Preparing Your First Harvest Gift from Mayor Lewis On all farm maps except for Meadowlands, Mayor Lewis gives you 15 Parsnip Seeds to start with. On Meadowlands, you receive 15 Hay instead. Use your axe, pickaxe, and scythe on the logs, stones, grass and bushes on your farm to clear about 15 tiles. Use your hoe to till the soil and plant the 15 Parsnip Seeds provided by Mayor Lewis. You obtain these on your first day on the floor inside your home. Use your watering can to water your seeds and soil. Continue watering your crops every day until they grow in to harvestable crops. Your parsnips will be ready to harvest in 4 days. Watering Can Main article: Watering Cans Crops needs to be watered daily in order to grow. The starting watering can only waters one tile at a time and can be refilled at any pond, river, or other body of water. This includes the kitchen sink, after getting your first house upgrade. Crops need to be watered every day. Crops that are not watered will not die, but they will not grow either. The best times to upgrade the watering can are the day before it is predicted to rain, as the rain will water the crops, or the 27th day of the season after watering any crops that are expected to ripen on the 28th. The Blacksmith will need 2 days to upgrade any tools, including the watering can. Sprinklers, which must be crafted and placed, will automatically water surrounding tiles every morning. Throughout the gameplay, sprinklers become available in 3 tiers that can water an increasing number of surrounding tiles, starting with 4 tiles (immediately adjacent to the sprinkler), 8 tiles (in the surrounding 3x3 area), and up to 24 tiles (in the surrounding 5x5 area). Energy Energy & Health Main article: Energy Energy limits productivity. One of the main ways to overcome this is by eating food. Eating food is an action, for which default controls are Right Click or type X with the food highlighted in your inventory and then click Yes in the confirmation dialogue to eat the food. Most crops and many foraged items can be eaten in order to regain energy. Some foods can also subtract energy; hover the cursor over the food to see how much energy it gives/takes away. Sleeping at the end of the day will restore the players' energy. After 12:00AM, the player won't restore 100% of the energy. If the player is exhausted when they go to bed or forced sleep at 2:00AM, they'll wake up in the morning with their energy level about half restored. In Multiplayer, lying in bed will regain energy over time. The Spa will fully restore energy over a short period of time. Skills Main article: Skills To level up skills, the player must complete certain actions related to that skill. Farming XP is earned by harvesting a fully grown crop and taking care of animals. Foraging XP is earned by foraging or chopping down trees. Mining XP is earned by breaking rocks and ore deposits. Fishing and using crab pots will increase fishing XP. Killing monsters will increase combat XP. As the skill level increases, the player will earn crafting recipes (every level except level 5 and 10) or professions (on level 5 and 10). Professions (level 5 and 10) can give the player a boost on yielding products, including more products gained, additional selling price, using less inventories and others. The player's choice of a level 5 profession will determine which profession choices are available at level 10. Villagers and Friendship Main articles: Villagers, Friendship See also: Marriage, List of All Gifts Talking and giving gifts to villagers will increase their friendship rating. You can talk to a villager by right-clicking on them. You can give a gift by highlighting it in your inventory or selecting it by typing its hotkey number and then left-clicking on the intended recipient. As friendship is earned villagers will send cooking recipes or gifts through the mail, give you access to their bedrooms, and treat you differently in dialogue. Unique cutscenes and interactions can also occur as friendship is earned. The player must also earn a high level of friendship in order to date, and eventually marry, an eligible villager. Whenever you talk or give a gift to a villager you get friendship points. You need 250 points to get 1 heart with them. Talking gives +20 points which can only be done once per day. Two gifts can be given per week, 1 gift per day. Television Main article: Television The television provides useful information, such as weather forecasts, daily luck, free cooking recipes, and other general tips. All players will have one inside their home when beginning a new game.

Cave Flies count towards the Monster Eradication Goal of 80 Cave Insects killed. Grubs hatch into Cave Flies shortly after entering their cocoon phase, during which time they are invulnerable. Be sure to kill off a critically-hit Grub before it can enter its cocoon. Behavior They fly at you (including through walls) at high speeds, damaging you on contact. Then they loop around for another pass. Strategy Stand still and swing at them with a sword with high knockback right before it hits you. A swarm event of Cave Flies (green mist) can easily overwhelm a low-level character, so it's advisable to carry enough stone to craft a staircase if you don't have an efficient weapon.

Rarecrow Society The world of Stardew Valley is described through various item descriptions, dialogue options, and Lost Books donated to the Museum. Races Humans Dwarves Shadow People Junimos Goblins Merpeople There are also Elves, Tundra Dwellers, and fairies. Humans Humans make up the majority of Stardew Valley's population. Most humans live normal lives, however Wizards and Witches still exist and study ancient arcane energies. Dwarves Dwarves call themselves 'Smoluanu', or 'Sky People'. They are known for living underground and once having advanced technology in ancient times. Archaeologist M. Jasper believes they are an alien race, as indicated in the Lost Book entitled Mysteries of the Dwarves. One dwarf can be found living in The Mines while a second is running a Shop in the Volcano Dungeon. Shadow People Shadow people are beings that cannot stand the light. They fought in the Elemental Wars when the Dwarves invaded their ancestral home deep underground. Krobus is a shadow person who can be found living in The Sewers. Most of the shadow people encountered in the game are monsters found in the Mines, known as Shadow Brutes and Shadow Shamans. Humans also call them Void Spirits. Junimos Main article: Junimos Keepers of the forest. They are spirits that live with the trees. Most of the Junimos can be found living in the Community Center. They have inspired the Junimo Kart video game. Fairies Fairies are magical beings which are mentioned in old legends but can also be encountered by the player. A fairy is summoned by the Fairy Box trinket. A fairy may occasionally appear to bless crops on the farm. As hinted in the item's description, the Fairy Rose attracts fairies and increases the chance of this happening. The description of Fairy Stone reads "An old miner's song suggests these are made from the bones of ancient fairies." Elves Nimble and skilled craftsmen. The description for Elvish Jewelry reads "Dirty but still beautiful. On the side is a flowing script thought by some to be the ancient language of the elves. No Elvish bones have ever been found." An elf quesadilla can be prepared by the chef at the Desert festival, granting the player +3 attack and +1 luck. Goblins Goblins are described in the Lost Book titled Goblins. The Henchman is a goblin who can be encountered guarding the Witch's Hut and will only move after being given Void Mayonnaise, which is considered a delicacy by the Goblin race. Merpeople Main article: The Merpeople The Wizard makes a reference to their existence during the Luau. At the Night Market there is a Mermaid Boat, where upon entering, a mermaid will appear and begin singing to the player, accompanied by a cutscene. On rainy days a Mermaid will appear on the large rock by the shore of the Pirate Cove on Ginger Island. Very rarely, a green sea monster might appear under the left-most pier at The Beach and then swim south. This may or may not be a merperson. It is purely cosmetic and cannot be caught by fishing. Two merpeople appear in the perfection cutscene. Tundra Dwellers Referenced by Linus at the Festival of Ice, when he says "Igloo-building's an art I picked up from the tundra dwellers who live beyond the frozen sea." This may simply be referring to a specific group of humans. Timeline The Elemental Wars An event referenced by the Wizard. It was the war between the Dwarves and Shadow People. The Dwarves, having driven the Shadow People from their ancestral home, forced the Shadow People to resort to violence. The Elemental Wars have long been finished, and the Dwarves and Shadow People must now live in peace for the sake of the humans living around them. Geography Stardew Valley Globe Stardew Valley World Map Stardew Valley A peaceful region located on the southern coast of the Ferngill Republic. Harvey identifies its location over his shortwave radio as 52 north, 43.5 east. Gem Sea The ocean that makes up the entire southern coast of Pelican Town. Rumors suggest that Gunther comes from across the Gem Sea. Fern Islands An archipelago in the Gem Sea belonging to the Ferngill Republic. Willy is from there. When married to Haley, if at 13 hearts she will ask the player if they ever thought about retirement. Haley wishes to spend your days together there. Gus usually uses Fern Island Ringfruit for his premier candy canes, according to his dialogue during the Feast of the Winter Star. Ginger Island can be accessed after repairing the boat in the backroom of Willys Fish Shop and buying tickets. Ginger Island is the only island available to visit in the archipelago, though other islands can be seen from the boat on the way there. Ginger island appears to be the largest island. Castle Village Castle Village is known for its "artisanal velvet" as mentioned in the description of Earmuffs. Its exact location is not mentioned. Zuzu City Panoramic night view of Zuzu City This is the City where a number of people from Pelican Town are from. Haley apparently has visited it, as The Queen of Sauce mentions that she reportedly fell in love with her Pink Cake after visiting Zuzu City. Alex notes that they have a gridball team called the Zuzu City Tunnelers, Sam mentions he used to live there, and Shane will take the Player to a match for his 10-heart event. Leah's ex, Kel, says in Leah's 10-heart event that they came all the way from Zuzu City to see the sculptures (Note: This only happens if you suggested the art show at the 2-heart event for Leah). After collecting all rarecrows, a letter is sent signed by "The Z.C. Rarecrow Society". The movie "The Zuzu City Express" also references Zuzu City. Grampleton One of the dialogue choices during Penny's 8-heart event may lead the player to refer to Stardew Valley's natural resources by saying "You'll find no better lumber south of Grampleton." During Clint's 6-heart event he invites Emily to the Grampleton Carnival. The movie "It Howls in the Rain" references Grampleton. One of the fishers at the Trout Derby says "I came all the way from Grampleton for this." Prairie Island Referenced in the movie "Natural Wonders: Exploring Our Vibrant World", it is an island far to the west of the Gem Sea, home to a diverse array of natural biomes and an abundant population of raccoons. The name "Prairie Island" possibly in reference to Journey of the Prairie King. Nations Ferngill Republic The nation in which Stardew Valley is located. Kent is a soldier for the Ferngill Republic, and is a survivor from a Gotoro prison camp. Morris believes that the Joja Corporation is good for the country as a whole. A plaque on the waiting room wall of Harvey's Clinic reads "This clinic is licensed for medical practice by the Ferngill Republic Health Authority." In Livin' Off The Land, on the 25th of Fall, Year 2, the host mentions that "it's just a couple of days until communities around the Ferngill Republic celebrate Spirit's Eve!" This suggests that the holiday is celebrated only in the Republic, but this is not elaborated further. Gotoro Empire Main article: Gotoro Empire A nation at war with the Ferngill Republic. Located across the Gem Sea, south of Stardew Valley. The Traveling Cart contains goods smuggled out of the Gotoro Empire. Religion Yoba's symbol Yoba Main article: Yoba Yoba is the creator deity. A shrine to Yoba is located in Pierre's General Store, and a Sign Of The Vessel can be found in Pams house once upgraded. Yoba is worshiped by both humans and shadow people, and a "sign of the vessel" appears on the plaque above the forge on Ginger island, suggesting the dwarves may also believe in Yoba. The symbol of Yoba can be found in various places throughout Stardew Valley. Organizations & Factions Joja Corporation Adventurer's Guild Joja Corporation A megacorp that seems to cover shipping, warehousing, distribution, mining activities, emergency medical services, and energy drink production. The Player used to work for them. Morris is the manager of the local JojaMart, and Sam, Shane and an unnamed cashier work at the local JojaMart unless the player completes the Community Center. Adventurer's Guild Main article: Adventurer's Guild A place where adventurers gather to swap stories and sell their loot, the Adventurer's Guild is for those who have proven themselves courageous and strong. The Player is initially not a part of the guild, but upon entering the Mines for the first time, they are sent a letter the following day from Marlon, the leader of the Adventurer's Guild, who invites you into the guild if you slay 10 slimes. Upon entering, you are able to purchase swords, rings, and boots, as well as receive rewards from Gil, an old adventurer, for completing monster-slaying goals. Z.C. Rarecrow Society A society that will send you the recipe for the Deluxe Scarecrow after you gather all eight of the Rarecrows.

Keepers of the forest. Junimos are forest spirits that have taken up residence in the broken down Community Center. The Player can complete Bundles for the Junimos by collecting and offering various items found in the Valley. When a bundle is completed, a Junimo will come and collect it, then stash it away in the hut in the main room of the Community Center. Completing a bundle will reward the player with an item. Completing all bundles in a room will reward the player with an improvement to the valley, and a star toward Community Center completion. After placing a star, a Junimo will follow the player around until the player leaves the Community Center. After all stars have been placed, the Community Center will be repaired, and the Junimos will return to the forest. During the night after all bundles in a room of the Community Center are completed, the player will see a cutscene in which the Junimos make the indicated improvement to the town. Completing a bundle on the day a child is due for birth or adoption may prevent the cutscene from triggering. If the player buys a JojaMart membership, the Community Center will be turned into a Joja Warehouse and the player will no longer see any Junimos unless they construct a Junimo Hut.

Trivia The Player can hit Junimos with a Slingshot or Master Slingshot, but they will not show a hate bubble. The ammo will hit the Junimo and a bursting animation will appear. When the player stands in front of a Junimo carrying a completed bundle to their hut in the community center, the Junimo will speed up like a villager would.

Hoes From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search The Hoe is a tool obtained at the beginning of the game. It is used primarily to till soil for Farming, and to dig up Artifact Spots. The hoe may also be used to till sand in The Mines, on The Beach, or in The Desert, as well as other areas of Stardew Valley that have exposed soil.

Behavior They behave identical to their weaker counterpart the Mummy. After being knocked down, they will get back up after 10 seconds unless killed by a bomb while downed. They will tremble slightly right before getting back up. Downed Mummies are temporarily immobilized and cannot be walked through, but do not deal contact damage. In this form, they are immune to all types of damage except for explosions, which will deal 999 fixed damage. Strategy Simply hit them until they fall into a pile of bandages, then use a bomb to kill them. Other explosive items work as well, such as Cherry Bombs and Explosive Ammo. To maximize efficiency, try to lure multiple Mummies into one area, preferably one with dense clusters of rocks, and bomb them all at once. Alternatively, players can avoid using any explosives to kill Mummies if they upgrade a weapon with the Crusader enchantment. Wearing a Napalm Ring will not automatically kill Mummies after knocking them down, and the explosions triggered by killing nearby Serpents and Carbon Ghosts are too small to be reliable, so manual bombing is usually required.

Flowers From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Flowers are a category that includes several crops grown on the farm. In addition, two foraged plants, Crocus and Sweet Peas, are considered to be flowers. Other foraged items that are real-life flowers (e.g., Dandelions and Daffodils) are categorized as Forage instead of Flower and therefore are not included here. All flowers share several in-game characteristics: Their sell prices are increased by 10% if the player has the Tiller profession (even foraged Crocus and Sweet Pea). Flowers grown as crops (i.e., other than Crocus and Sweet Pea) will affect the type of Honey produced by nearby Bee Houses. Flowers (other than Poppy) are a universally liked gift; all villagers other than Clint, George, and Sebastian like them. Gifting foraged flowers can be an inexpensive way to level up friendship. Flowers (combined with Forage and Tree Sap) are one category used when scoring items in the Grange Display at the Stardew Valley Fair. They can be sold at the General Store (as well as in the Shipping Bin). All shipped flowers are added to the Items Shipped page of the Collections tab.

Enricher From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Enricher Place on a sprinkler and load with fertilizer to automatically apply it when planting seeds nearby. Information Source Qi's Walnut Room for data-sort-value="20"> 20 Sell Price data-sort-value="200">200g An Enricher is a Sprinkler upgrade that automatically fertilizes tiles when seeds are planted. Fertilizer must be loaded into the Enricher before the seeds are planted for it to work. Despite the fact that it is attached to a sprinkler, the enricher will automatically apply the loaded fertilizer as soon as seeds are planted within that sprinkler's normal range. There is no need for the sprinkler to water the tiles for the fertilizer to be applied. Only one fertilizer type may be loaded into an enricher at a time. The player must load as many of that fertilizer type as they wish to have applied to the surrounding seeds (e.g., an iridium sprinkler has a range of 24 plantable tiles, so the equipped enricher would need 24 of any given fertilizer loaded to cover the entire range of the sprinkler). A sprinkler may not be equipped with both a Pressure Nozzle and an enricher at the same time. 4 Enrichers can be purchased at Qi's Walnut Room for data-sort-value="20"> 20 Qi Gems or one may occasionally be found in the Mines as a special monster drop during the 'Danger In The Deep' quest or after activating the Shrine of Challenge or Skull Cavern (during the "Skull Cavern Invasion" Quest). An Enricher applied to each type of sprinkler Tips Because fertilizer never needs to be replaced in the Greenhouse, the enricher will have only one-time use there. Additionally, because fertilizer does not disappear when already applied to a tile with something planted on it, it has limited use for crops that continually produce (especially on Ginger Island where crops will not die due to season changes).

Lightning Rod From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Lightning Rod Collects energy from lightning storms and turns it into battery packs. Information Source Crafting Season Spring  Summer  Fall Sell Price Cannot be sold Crafting Recipe Source Foraging (Level 6) Ingredients Iron Bar (1) Refined Quartz (1) Bat Wing (5) The Lightning Rod creates a Battery Pack the day after getting hit by lightning during a storm. It is not necessary for the player to be on the farm when the lightning strike happens. Lighting Rods also protect The Farm, because lightning that is not intercepted can strike Fruit Trees or destroy Crops, Trees and Farm Debris. Since rods do not protect a specific area, the exact placement of a rod on the farm has no bearing on its chance to intercept a lightning strike. A Lightning Rod has a very good chance of intercepting a lightning bolt if it isn't already processing one.[1] After being hit, the Lightning Rod changes to a "processing" state for the remainder of the day and will not intercept any additional strikes, so multiple rods are needed to intercept additional strikes. The number of lightning strikes during one day is random, and increases with higher daily luck.[2] A lightning rod is the reward for completing the 10,000 Bundle in the Vault.

Slime Ball From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Slime Ball Filled with slime. Information Source Slime Hutch Season All Sell Price Cannot be sold Slimes produce Slime Balls in a Slime Hutch on a daily basis, but only if there are enough slimes present and the water troughs are filled. Up to four slime balls per day are possible in one Slime Hutch, and the types of slimes present has no impact on spawning. The minimum requirements for just one slime ball to form is at least five slimes (of any gender) and at least one filled water trough.[1] To get four slime balls per day, there must be at least 20 slimes living in the hutch and all four water troughs must be filled. Whether or not the slimes can reach the water troughs (because of obstacles placed in the hutch) does not matter. There must also be enough unoccupied tiles in the hutch; note that slime balls cannot spawn on crafted flooring. The Slime Ball can be right-clicked to release multiple Slime items. Slime balls also have a rare chance to have Petrified Slime inside. Bugs On mobile versions of the game, loading a middle-of-the-day save file (either an Emergency Save or a Backup Save), causes all water troughs in Slime Hutches to be prematurely emptied. Therefore, Slime Balls will never spawn the following morning. To reliably produce Slime Balls on mobile versions of the game, it is best to fill water troughs at the end of the day, shortly before going to sleep. References ?

Weight From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Weight is a statistic that affects how far an enemy will be knocked back when attacked by the player with a weapon. Each weapon type has a default weight: Daggers have a weight of 5, swords 10, and clubs 15. Some weapons have a weight modifier, which is added to or subtracted from the default weight.[1] Forging a weapon with Amethysts will add +10 per amethyst to the weight. Amethyst Rings and innate enchantments affect the weight multiplicatively: the multiplier starts out as 1.0. Each Amethyst Ring adds 0.1 to the multiplier, while a "-X Weight" innate enchantment will subtract X/10 from the multiplier. The actual weight value is then the weapon's weight times this multiplier.[2] This means 2 Amethyst rings increase the amount of knockback by 1.2x, while a maximum-level innate enchantment (-5 Weight) will halve the knockback amount. Weapons The following weapons affect Weight. The effect is permanent while using the weapon. Image Name Effect Crystal Dagger Crit. Power (+50) Weight (+5) Wind Spire Crit.

For example, when wearing the Genie Shoes, which provides 6 points of Immunity, the chance of being debuffed is 40%.[1] If wearing equipment that provide sufficient total Immunity (+10 or more), the player can stay completely free from any debuffs.

However, each time a fish escapes the "fishing bar", the catch is reduced. Information Source Crafting  Golden Fishing Treasure Chests Energy Inedible Sell Price data-sort-value="1">1g Crafting Recipe Source Fishing Mastery Ingredients Bone Fragment (5) Moss (2) Produces 5 Bait per craft Challenge Bait is used to catch up to 3 fish at once. It reduces the delay before a nibble on a fishing rod by 62.5%, the same as with Wild Bait.[1] It can be crafted after claiming Fishing Mastery. It can also be found in Golden Fishing Treasure Chests (7% chance).[2] The amount of fish that the player has on the line is displayed right outside of the mini-game display on the top-right. It starts at 3 and decreases by one each time the fish leaves the fishing bar. So 3 fish will be caught at once only if the player catches the fish perfectly. The fish will escape if it leaves the fishing bar 3 times. Note that catching multiple fish does not grant additional fishing experience points. However, catching multiple fish while working on a fishing or special order quest counts all of them toward the required total. Challenge Bait can be used to catch up to 3 of the same Legendary Fish. Challenge Bait cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod, the Iridium Rod, and the Advanced Iridium Rod can use bait. Challenge bait can also technically be used in a Crab Pot, but it is no better than standard bait. Contents 1 Use 2 Gifting 3 Bundles 4 Tailoring 5 Quests 6 References 7

Dried Mushrooms A package of gourmet mushrooms. Information Source Artisan Goods Sell Price (7.5 × mushroom Base Price) + 25 Artisan Goods Equipment Dehydrator Processing Time 1750m (?1d) Ingredients Any positive energy mushrooms (5) Dried Mushrooms are an Artisan Good made from the Dehydrator, taking one in-game day. 5 mushrooms of the same quality are required to produce 1 bag of Dried Mushrooms. The amount of energy and health restored from Dried Mushrooms is 3 times the base mushroom Energy/Health restoration. The sell price of Dried Mushrooms depends on the mushrooms used ((7.5 x mushroom Base Price) + 25) total, or ((1.5x mushroom Base Price) + 5) per mushroom used. When the player has the Artisan profession, the sell price changes to ((10.5 x mushroom Base Price) + 35) total, or ((2.1x mushroom Base Price) + 7) per mushroom used. Since value is based on mushroom Base Price alone, the actual benefit compared to selling the raw mushrooms will decrease for mushrooms of higher quality. For example, if the Artisan profession is not chosen, iridium quality mushrooms will generally make a loss if dehydrated and gold quality only make a 5g profit per mushroom.

Pickaxes From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search The Pickaxe is a tool obtained at the beginning of the game. It is used mainly for breaking stones, particularly when Mining, although it has other uses and can also remove certain objects. For example, the pickaxe can be used to pick up placed items, such as floor tiles, sprinklers, or artisan equipment, much like an axe. In a similar way, the pickaxe can also strike small plants like weeds or other crops on the farm to remove them. Only the pickaxe can un-till soil that has previously been tilled (i.e., it can remove strikes from a Hoe). This process is overall done in two stages; striking once will remove any crops on top, leaving the underlying tilled soil intact (including any fertilizer present). Striking a second time tilled soil will revert the tile to an un-tilled state, removing any applied fertilizer. The pickaxe also applies this two-stage removal process to for items placed on top of floor tiles, while the axe will remove both the object and the floor at once. Also, using the pickaxe on a Monster will deal a small portion of damage, similar to other weapons. However, another unique use case is hitting a Crab 5 times with a pickaxe which will knock off its shell, and cause the crab to flee rather than attack the player. Grades of Pickaxe The Pickaxe may be upgraded at the Blacksmith. The cost and resource requirements for each upgrade are shown in the table below. As a summary of the upgrade effects, with each upgrade level the number of hits required to break a stone or node is reduced, and it becomes possible to break harder types of rocks. Image Name Cost Ingredients Improvements Pickaxe Starter Tool N/A Can break small rocks anywhere.

Mutant Grubs count towards the 80 Cave Insects killed for Monster Eradication Goals. Behavior Mutant Grubs appear in groups and attack on sight. Upon sustaining critical damage, they will flee and attempt to pupate. When pupating, a Mutant Grub turns darker green and is immune to all damage. It will emerge as a Mutant Fly. Strategy Attempt to separate them from their groups to avoid being overrun. If you find a single grub, simply attack it constantly and chase it down if it tries to escape. They do not charge you like slimes do, making it impossible for them to hit you if you have a weapon with decent knockback. If you encounter a group of grubs, use a weapon with medium or high knockback to push them all into a corner, that way none of them can escape. Just make sure to not let any escape from the corner, as fighting a flying insect and a group of grubs is quite dangerous, especially if there are a lot of grubs. Explosive ammo from your slingshot also works well.

The player must be standing at the far east end of the beach, which can be reached after repairing the small bridge for 300 wood or purchasing the second community upgrade. Any location on the eastern pier works, as does any location on the shore east of the pier. The bobber must be located in water with a Fishing Zone of at least 3, i.e., it must be at least four tiles away from any land (including the pier) in every direction. The Crimsonfish can appear one tile closer to land (Zone=2) if the bobber lands in Bubbles. When all of these requirements are met, each cast has an 18% chance of hooking a Crimsonfish (25% if using a Curiosity Lure). Although the Crimsonfish cannot be hooked again after it is caught, it is possible to obtain multiple Crimsonfish (per player) by using Challenge Bait to catch it.

When killed, they may drop Crab Cakes and up to 3 Iridium Ore. They may also very rarely drop a Diamond or Prismatic Shard when killed. 60 rock crabs (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild. Behavior They disguise themselves as Iridium Nodes, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack, though they can be hit with a pickaxe to knock them back, making them mobile again. Strategy Iridium Crabs may be differentiated from Iridium Nodes by striking them with a Sword. An Iridium Crab will make a knocking sound and a zero damage indicator will pop up when hit with a sword, while an Iridium Node will not. The Iridium Crab can only be dealt damage if it is mobile, and not hiding beneath its shell. Strike an immobile Iridium Crab with the pickaxe to make it mobile again. Striking an Iridium Crab with a pickaxe enough times will knock the shell off of its back, and will cause it to flee. Alternatively, setting off a bomb near an Iridium Crab can remove its shell, and will cause it to flee as well. A Mega Bomb is particularly effective at removing Iridium Crab shells.

Behavior They disguise themselves as stones, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack, though they can be hit with a pickaxe to knock them back, making them mobile again. Strategy Rock Crabs may be differentiated from rocks by striking them with a weapon. A Rock Crab will make a knocking sound and a zero damage indicator will pop up when hit with a weapon, while a rock will not. The Rock Crab can only be dealt damage if it is mobile, and not hiding beneath its shell. Strike an immobile Rock Crab with a pickaxe to make it mobile again. Striking a Rock Crab with a pickaxe enough times will knock the shell off of its back, and will cause it to flee. Alternatively, setting off a bomb near a Rock Crab can remove its shell, and will cause it to flee as well.

For the object in the mines, see The Mines#Crates and Barrels. Supply Crates sometimes wash up on the shore of the Beach Farm.

Behavior Spiders will jump next to the player, and deal damage on hit. They are immune to damage while jumping. They tend to spawn in large swarms, and can easily overwhelm a player who is not equipped with a strong enough weapon. Strategy Their immunity to knockback makes them an ideal target for a hammer's special attack, which can kill many of them in an instant. It is almost impossible to fight large numbers of them without taking damage, so an alternate strategy is to simply swing a Vampiric sword repeatedly and try to out-heal any damage taken. Alternatively, a weapon enchanted with Bug Killer can help deal greater damage. While fighting Spiders, beware of nearby Putrid Ghosts.

At the Night Market, one free cup of coffee per night can be obtained from the Desert Trader. Coffee is sold at the Desert Festival in George's and Harvey's shops.

As a drink, its buff stacks with any food buffs (including Speed), but replaces any other drink buffs (i.e., from Triple Shot Espresso, Ginger Ale or Green Tea). Unlike all other Keg products, Coffee is not considered to be an Artisan Good. Therefore, its sale price does not benefit from the Artisan profession. Also, Coffee cannot be sold to the General Store; it must be sold using the Shipping Bin. Note that 5 beans of the same quality (normal, silver, or gold) must be used to make coffee; the keg will not accept beans that are not in one stack of 5.

Crit. Chance From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Crit. Chance (short for Critical Chance) is a Combat statistic. When performing an attack, this stat will determine the likelihood to perform a stronger attack with increased damage. A special sound plays when hitting a critical strike, and the damage numbers that pop up show the greater damage amount. Bonus damage done by critical strikes is equal to base damage × (3 + Crit. Power / 50). The crit chance tooltip is not in any way added to the chance to crit. It is rather calculated from the base crit chance, including the bonus received by daggers[1]. Each point of crit chance is roughly equivalent to a 2% chance to crit. How the critical hit chance works is discussed in Critical hit chance. Increasing Crit.

A mature plant yields a Sweet Gem Berry. One to five Rare Seeds can be purchased at the Traveling Cart for data-sort-value="1000">1,000g each during Spring and Summer. During any season, there is also a 1.26% chance that the merchant will be selling 1-5 Rare Seeds for data-sort-value="200"6001,000g each. (It is possible for Rare Seeds to occupy two slots in the merchant's offerings in Spring and Summer). Rare Seeds can also be obtained by using the Seed Maker. Despite the description stating that this seed "takes all season to grow", it takes only 24 days. If using fertilizer that speeds crop growth or having the Agriculturist Profession, it will take fewer days.

Since a Sweet Gem Berry is worth at least data-sort-value="3000">3,000g, each Rare Seed produced from the Seed Maker is created at a cost of data-sort-value="1500">1,500g to data-sort-value="3000">3,000g depending on the quality of the input. This makes the maximum price of data-sort-value="1000">1,000g at the Traveling Cart a much better buy, even though the quantities offered there are limited. Rare Seeds bought from the Traveling Cart yield the highest per-day profit of any crop. But if rare seeds are farmed in quantity with seeds produced by a Seed Maker, per-day profits drop dramatically. Assuming the player gets an average of 1.975 seeds per equipment use, seeds made from regular quality Sweet Gem Berries yield profits at a minimum rate of only about data-sort-value="60.9">60.9g per day each. Using silver quality fruit for seeds, profits drop to about data-sort-value="45.3">45.3g per day each, still the highest of any crop. Using gold quality fruit for seeds, minimum profits are about data-sort-value="29.7">29.7g per day, less than a few other crops. These numbers are based on the value of new crops grown at regular quality, and can be raised significantly if they are fertilized and higher quality crops are received in return. This suggests that best results will usually be achieved by selling gold-quality crops as is, without making them into seeds, and using only lesser quality fruit for seeds and replanting. Notes A Livin' Off The Land tip (Fall 1, Year 2) informs the player that Rare Seeds take only 24 days to grow, and not a full season (28 days).

There is also a 2% chance that the screen and ConcernedApe logo will turn green and have leaves fill the screen, similar to the effect when drinking the Forest Magic potion.[1] See also Developer Blog Stardew Valley Interviews: Interview with Eric Barone, Creator of Stardew Valley, Kristi's Blog, 07 October 2012 One on One, Metagamingtv, 02 March 2013 Show Us Your Rig: Stardew Valley's Eric Barone, PCGamer, 05 January 2016 Stardew Valley: Pushing The Boundaries of Farming RPGs, Cornell Sun, 23 February 2016 GI Show, Game Informer, 10 March 2016 The creators of Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon talk to us about farm games, PC Gamer, 01 December 2016 Valley Forged: How One Man Made the Indie Video Game Sensation Stardew Valley, GQ, 20 March 2018 Stardew Valley's Creator on Self-Publishing, the "Everything" Update, and His Future as a Solo Developer, USgamer, 08 October 2019 Auburn native develops beloved, bestselling video game (with video), King5 News, 15 April 2020 How Stardew Valley Keeps Building On Success, GameInformer, 08 September 2020 References ?

Garbage Can From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search For the upgradeable garbage cans found in the player menu, see Trash Cans. Garbage Cans can be found next to buildings in Pelican Town. If you "use" one (right-click on it), you can sometimes find a valuable item. There are eight garbage cans in total: The Stardrop Saloon, 1 River Road, the Mayor's Manor, 1 Willow Lane, 2 Willow Lane, the Blacksmith, the Museum and JojaMart/Movie Theater. Garbage cans have predetermined contents each day. The chance for this predetermined item to drop is affected by daily luck. In addition, certain garbage cans have special drops which have a chance to replace the predetermined drop. This chance is partially affected by daily luck. The first reading of The Alleyway Buffet will increase the chance to find items by 20%.[1] Garbage Cans will play an animation when interacted with. The top comes off briefly, revealing that the trash inside changes color with the seasons. A Garbage Can's lid may randomly pop off extra high and play an extra loud sound. In addition, if a Garbage Hat is found, the can's lid will make an exploding noise, and the lid will disappear for a period of time. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter If you interact with a garbage can near any villager other than Linus, you will repulse the villager and lose 25 friendship points with them. The villager must be in a 15x15 square centered at your character to be offended. If Linus catches you digging through a Garbage Can, you will gain 5 friendship points with him.[2] Linus' attitude towards digging through garbage cans is revealed in his 50-points heart event, but it rarely matters since (other than during the cutscene) he can only be seen in town one day a year, on Winter 15, walking to the Night Market.

Targeted Bait From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. Targeted Bait Increases your chances to catch (fish name). Information Source Bait Maker  Fish Shop Energy Inedible Sell Price 0.1 × Fish Price Targeted Bait is a specialized type of bait which increases the chance of hooking a specific fish in a given area provided the fish can be caught in that area at that time, weather, and season. The bite rate for any targeted bait is the same as for standard bait (reduces the delay before a nibble by 50%).[1] It can be obtained from a Bait Maker after putting in any fish, which will result in 5-10 "[insert fish name here] Bait." The player can also purchase 8-12 targeted bait of a specific fish per day from the Fish Shop for double the sell price (0.2 x Fish price). When using targeted bait, the Locational Chance[2] and Spawn Rate for the targeted fish are both multiplied by 1.66, after applying any relevant modifiers.[3] These chances are capped at 1, so in most cases the Locational Chance adjustment will have no effect as most fish have a Locational Chance of 1. However, the Spawn Rate normally has a cap of 0.9, so this adjustment can guarantee a fish passing that check, assuming that a different item is not hooked first. In addition, when choosing from the list of possible catches for the area, the game will look at the first three items to pass both the Spawn Rate and Location-based checks. If the targeted fish is among them, the player will hook the targeted fish. Otherwise, the player will hook the third item, whatever it may be. If the game reaches the end of the list of possible catches before three items have passed both checks, it will loop back to the beginning of the list and check each item a second time.[4] If it reaches the end of the list a second time, the player will hook trash.[5] Targeted Bait also works with Crab Pots. Its effect depends on the chance of the targeted fish.[6] Specifically, if the player does not have the Mariner profession: Lobster chance is quadrupled. Clam, Crab, and Oyster chances are tripled. All other Crab Pot fish chances are doubled. If the player has the Mariner profession, all Crab Pot fish chances are tripled.

Grub (dangerous) From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Grub (dangerous) Information Spawns In: Dangerous Mines Floors: 41-69 Killable: Yes Base HP: 265 Base Damage: 12-13 Base Def: 0 Speed: 1 XP: 2 Variations: Grub Mutant Grub Drops: Ancient Seed (0.5%) Bug Meat (60%) Dwarf Scroll I (0.5%) Dwarf Scroll IV (0.1%) Rice Shoot (10%) White Algae (2%) If reached bottom of Mines: Diamond (0.05%) Prismatic Shard (0.05%) Grubs (dangerous) are an enemy found in the Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. Behavior Pupating Grub Grubs appear in groups and attack on sight. Upon sustaining critical damage, they will flee and attempt to pupate. When pupating, a Grub turns blue and is immune to all damage. It will emerge from its blue cocoon as a Cave Fly (dangerous). Strategy Attempt to separate them from their groups to avoid being overrun. If you find a single grub, simply attack it constantly and chase it down if it tries to escape. They do not charge you like Slimes do, making it impossible for them to hit you if you have a weapon with decent knockback. If you encounter a group of grubs, use a weapon with medium or high knockback to push them all into a corner, that way none of them can escape. Just make sure to not let any escape from the corner, as fighting a flying insect and a group of grubs is quite dangerous, especially if there are a lot of grubs. Explosive ammo from your slingshot also works well.

Tea Bush From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Tea Bush Information Seed Tea Sapling Growth Time 20 days Harvest Season Spring  Summer  Fall Produces Tea Leaves A Tea Bush is a type of bush that grows from a Tea Sapling. It takes 20 days to grow to maturity, after which it will produce one Tea Leaf each day during the last week (22nd-28th) of Spring, Summer, and Fall (and Winter if indoors). One Tea Bush exists inside of Caroline's sunroom, and can also be harvested at the same time as other Tea Bushes (the last week of each season). An immature Tea Bush grows at any time, even outdoors, even in winter, without watering, the same as fruit trees. As with fruit trees, Tree Fertilizer cannot be used on tea bushes. Stages Once planted, neither players nor animals can walk through a Tea Bush at any stage of growth. A mature bush can be chopped down by 2 hits with a Gold or Iridium Axe, but is not vulnerable to other tools. They yield their sapling when chopped. Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Harvest 10 Days 10 Days Until 21st of the season Total: 20 Days Continues to produce every day. Tips It is possible to use tea bushes like permanent fences, to help contain farm animals within a barnyard. While you cannot typically place tea bushes outside the farm, you can place Garden Pots and then place tea bushes into them. They will grow and bear leaves as usual, and of course don't need watering.

Ring of Yoba From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Ring of Yoba Occasionally shields the wearer from damage. Information Source: Crafting with Combat Level 7 Ingredients: Iron Bar (5) Gold Bar (5) Diamond (1) Adventurer's Guild Purchase Price: Not Sold Sell Price: data-sort-value="750 ">750g The Ring of Yoba is a ring that can be crafted after earning the recipe at Combat Level 7. The ingredients are: 5 Iron Bars, 5 Gold Bars, and 1 Diamond. The Ring of Yoba has a chance of giving the Yoba's Blessing buff after the player takes damage. The Yoba's Blessing buff grants immunity to monster-based damage for 5 seconds. It does not protect against damage caused by falling down Skull Cavern shafts. The chance of receiving the buff is increased by low health and by Luck buffs, but not daily Luck. It can activate once the player's health drops below 90. After that, it increases linearly until 15 health, below which an additive 20% bonus to the activation chance applies. This is calculated[1] as (0.9 - HP / 100) / (3 - Luck Level / 10) + Bonus where Bonus is 0.2 if health is 15 or less. For 0 Luck, this means 50-45% activation chance between 0 HP and 15 HP and 25%-0% activation chance between 16 HP and 90 HP. This chance does not stack by wearing multiple Rings of Yoba. The game only checks whether or not a Ring of Yoba is equipped before attempting the chance for the buff, it does not repeat this chance multiple times if multiple rings are equipped.

Day Cycle From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Getting Started The Player Options Controls Mobile Controls Health Energy Skills Day Cycle The in-game date/time display. This shows the day of month (Monday 1), weather (sunny), season (spring), time, and gold count. See also: Days of the Week The Day Cycle is a period of 20 hours in-game from 6am to 2am in which the Player (farmer) is able to work and perform other activities around the Valley. The player will always wake up at the same time every day, but they are able to choose to go to bed whenever they like, which in turn ends the day. Contents 1 Effects 1.1 Passing out 1.2 Darkness 1.3 Villagers and locations 1.4 Fishing 1.5 Animals 1.6 Night 2 Passage of time 3 References Effects The main effects of the day cycle on the player character are the processes of sleeping and saving that happen overnight. The player may choose to go to bed at any hour to sleep and progress time to the morning of the next day. This is done by moving into the area inside of any bed, and a dialogue will prompt them to confirm the decision. However as a reminder, as time passes midnight (12:00 am) the player's character will show that they are tired and in need of sleep. Sleep will restore the player's Energy and Health to full if they go to bed no later than midnight and are not exhausted, and to half if they pass out or are exhausted. The longer past midnight the player stays awake, the less energy they wake up with, with about 75% restored if they sleep at 1am, and 50% if they sleep right before 2am. Regardless of when the player sleeps, there will be no further impact on the next day  the player will wake up and become active at 6am as usual, even if they stay up late. Therefore even though the day will go on until 2am, there is no requirement to stay awake for the whole day; conversely there is also no immediate need to sleep as soon as the clock turns to midnight. The game saves only after the player has gone to sleep and the daily profit breakdown has been accepted, signaling the start of a new day. In multiplayer, it is possible to "nap" during the daytime when positioned inside a bed. The normal sleep confirmation dialogue will appear for that player, and all players will see an automatic message announcing the player's intent to sleep. The player will slowly regain energy and health as time passes, at 2 points per second,[1],\ like at the Spa. When in bed, a dialogue will indicate how many other players are also waiting to end the day. There will be no additional messages if they choose to get up out of bed and later return to bed. Finally, note that in multiplayer, all players must be sleeping simultaneously (or pass out) to progress to the overnight profit breakdown, and all players must click "ok" to close the profit breakdown screen in order to save and start the next day. Passing out The player can stay awake until 2am, after which their character will pass out. This means the player is unable to be active after 2am, even if they have energy remaining. If the character passes out outside their Farmhouse or Cabin, they will wake up in bed, having been dragged there by either a JojaMart medical team, Linus, Marlon, or Dr. Harvey if they are not married to him. In each case except Marlon's, 10% of the player's gold, up to a maximum of data-sort-value="1000">1,000g (or data-sort-value="2500">2,500g on Ginger Island, including the Volcano Dungeon), will be lost. The details of this transaction will appear as a letter in the player's mailbox the next day, although Linus does not count the gold lost (the amount is still stored in the save file). There is no penalty for falling asleep while inside a Farmhouse or Cabin. In a multiplayer game, any player that passes out will be announced in chat, even if they are inside the farmhouse. Darkness Depending on the season, nightfall is at different times. In Spring and Summer, it is 8pm, while in Fall it is at 7pm and Winter is 6pm. At nightfall, the background noise may change, and indoors the windows turn dark and lamps and sconces light up. Indoor locations also become dark at night (unless fully lit by light sources), but if nightfall happens while you are indoors it stays light until you exit and re-enter. At night outdoors, it does not immediately become full dark, but gradually becomes darker over time. Villagers and locations Villagers will move to different locations around the Valley depending on the time, combined with some additional influence from days of the week. The time of day also affects what locations are open, including shops according to their Shop Schedules. For example, most locations in Pelican Town generally open at 9am. Fishing Certain fish only appear at certain times of the day. For example, it is considered nighttime after 6pm, which makes it possible to catch some nighttime fish. However as an aside, it does not become dark until around 8pm, depending on the season. Other specific fish might only be active at certain hours during the daytime, such as a period during the morning or afternoon. Animals Animals will leave their coop or barn at the start of the day if it is possible to do so (the weather is sunny and the building's animal door is left open). This allows them to eat grass. In the evening they will return to the building to sleep. These animals will attempt to return to their coop or barn at 5pm on their own, will start going to sleep at 7pm, and will stop moving around the building by themselves at 8pm. After that time they will settle down and stay in one place. They normally cannot be interacted with while they are asleep, making it impossible to raise their heart level. The heart level of cows and goats, however, is increased through successful milking, which can be done any time, including while they are sleeping. The advantage of milking after 8pm is that animals will never walk away and be out of range. Sometimes animals will refuse to go inside, moving around like they would during the day even at midnight. This can be fixed by leaving and re-entering the farm, and the animals will be automatically moved inside. Exiting the barn and re-entering is another option; the animals will change position randomly. Night For purposes of processing times of items like Kegs, Furnaces, Oil Makers, etc. a full day of 20 hours counts as 1200 minutes, but time passes differently from 2am to 6am, with each hour counting as 100 minutes. This means that processing activities that normally take longer than 240 minutes (4 hours), but less than 400 minutes, like making oil (360 minutes) or smelting gold (300 minutes), will still be completed by 6am if started at 1:50am. This also means that each full 24 hour time period counts as 1600 minutes instead of 1440 minutes. Passage of time Time passes at 0.7 real seconds per in-game minute (except the Skull Cavern where it's 0.9). In single-player mode, time will pause (and the clock will blink in grayed-out text) when viewing a cutscene, viewing a dialog or menu (like the game menu, billboard, or quest journal), and during some animations (like reeling in a fish or jumping on/off a horse). In multiplayer mode, the game doesn't pause automatically. Ignoring pauses, in-game time maps to real time like so: Game time Real time Real time in Skull Cavern 10 minutes 7 seconds 9 seconds 1 hour 42 seconds 54 seconds Full day 6am to 2am, 20 hours 14 minutes 18 minutes Week (full days) 1 hour, 38 minutes 2 hours, 6 minutes Season (full days) 6 hours, 32 minutes 8 hours, 24 minutes Year (full days) 26 hours, 8 minutes 33 hours, 36 minutes References ?

Seasons From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search There are four Seasons in Stardew Valley: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. Each Season lasts 28 days. The game begins on the first day of Spring. After completing a cycle of seasons, the game moves forward one year when Spring starts again. Years are tied to a few events, but there's no limit on the number of years which can be played. A villager's daily routines may change with a new season or with some events. Each season comes with a distinctive visual style. Each season has 2-4 festivals. At festivals, the Pelican Town community gathers for special activities. These include special items can be purchased, games played, prizes won, and information gained. Most crops, Foraging items, and fish are available only during their particular season or seasons. The seed selection available in Pierre's General Store (or JojaMart) changes each season. Some areas are unaffected by the seasons, including indoor and underground areas, The Desert and Ginger Island. Transition When a season ends (end of day 28), crops wither and die unless they can also grow during the coming season (pay attention to those growing days). At that time, fertilizer used on soil also expires, unless it is on a tile where a continuing multi-season crop is planted. During seasonal shifts, your farm will also experience minor disrepair: the fallowing of tilled land, and the appearance of random debris that also must be cleared before planting can begin again. Land that is still planted when the season changes does not undergo disrepair. During the shift from Winter to Spring (next year), your farm experiences a major disrepair where more debris appears. Trivia In the startup cutscene, you arrive in Stardew Valley and it is not Winter. Yet you awaken the next day, your first day, and it is Spring 1.

Oak Tree From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Oak Tree Information Seed Acorn Tapper Product Oak Resin Growth Time Variable An Oak Tree is a common Tree that grows from an Acorn. It yields Oak Resin every 7-8 days when tapped. It can be chopped down with an axe, producing Wood, Sap, possible Acorns, and possible Hardwood (if the player is a Lumberjack). A planted Acorn grows through four stages before reaching maturity (with twice as much time spent at stage 4). If fertilized, this takes five days (even in Winter). Otherwise, there is a 20% chance per day of growth, except in winter when trees do not grow. The median time to maturity is 24 days, although individual tree growth times will vary considerably. Chopping a stage 23 tree with an axe has a chance to drop one wood, depending on foraging level. This doesn't happen when cutting it with other tools. Oak Trees outside the farm (except in Pelican Town) can be chopped down or tapped. These trees will respawn as Stage 3 saplings (20% chance each day) and grow as normal after that, as long as the stump is removed, and there is nothing on the tree's tile. Stages of Growth Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4 Stage 5 - Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter Stump - Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter

Pine Tree From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Pine Tree Information Seed Pine Cone Tapper Product Pine Tar Growth Time Variable A Pine Tree is a common Tree that grows from a Pine Cone. It yields Pine Tar every 5-6 days when tapped. It can be chopped down with an axe, producing Wood, Sap, possible Pine Cones, and possible Hardwood (if the player is a Lumberjack). A planted Pine Cone grows through four stages before reaching maturity (with twice as much time spent at stage 4). If fertilized, this takes five days (even in Winter). Otherwise, there is a 20% chance per day of growth, except in winter when trees do not grow. The median time to maturity is 24 days, although individual tree growth times will vary considerably. Chopping a stage 23 tree with an axe has a chance to drop one wood, depending on foraging level. This doesn't happen when cutting it with other tools. Pine Trees outside the farm (except in Pelican Town) can be chopped down or tapped. These trees will respawn as Stage 3 saplings (20% chance each day) and grow as normal after that, as long as the stump is removed, and there is nothing on the tree's tile.

Hay Hopper From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Hay Hopper Provides convenient access to silo fodder. Information Cost: N/A The Hay Hopper is a tool that moves hay between a silo and the player's inventory. It comes with all Barns and Coops, and cannot be picked up or moved. Once hay is dispensed by right-clicking on the Hay Hopper, it can be placed on the feeding bench where animals can eat it. Hay can be placed into a silo by holding the hay in inventory and right-clicking on the Hay Hopper. The Hay Hopper in a Deluxe Barn or Deluxe Coop has an autofeed system, so hay is moved to the Feeding Bench automatically. This prevents the player from manually withdrawing hay from the hopper. Hay can still be deposited into a Hay Hopper with an autofeed system. Tips Hay can be stored in a chest instead of a silo. In order to store hay that is cut from grass on the farm in a chest, simply withdraw hay from the Hay Hopper and place it in a chest. This requires at least one barn or coop that has vacant spaces on the feeding bench. Deluxe barns/coops automatically fill the bench, but the hay can be destroyed with bombs, re-enabling withdrawal. If you are married, eventually your spouse will feed the farm animals, automatically filling the feeding benches in every Coop or Barn. Placing chests or other equipment in front of the Hay Hopper and feeding bench in order to block spouse access does not work. In this case, a bomb can clear the feeding bench to re-enable hay withdrawal.

The Mines/Ore Distribution From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Article Stub This article is marked as a stub for the following reason: Work in progress Small minable stones and ores can appear as random stones throughout the floor, or rarely as small clumps. These have different distributions[1][2]. On average there will be less than 0.67 small resource clumps on each floor with neutral luck, and less than 1 for the largest possible luck. The other type of resource found are large (2 by 2) stones, as well as random items. The mine difficulty can also be changed by using the Shrine of Challenge or by accepting the Qi quest Danger in the Deep. This provides 3 levels, normal (0), one of these active (1), or both of these active (2). If the mine is difficult, radioactive ore can appear, as well as large stumps and large logs. The double up of difficulty has a few affects; those relevant to this page are that it increases the chance of finding radioactive ore, monsters spawning and leapers having partners. Floors have a chance of being a quarry level, which modifies the chances and are dealt with separately. From random stones, for the normal mines, there is a 2.9% chance to get copper ore on floors 2-39, or gold ore on floors 81-119; and on floors 41-79, there is a 15% chance to get ice crystals and a 2.465% chance to get iron ore. Contents 1 Populate Levels 2 Mine Area 3 Random ore placement (stoneChance and chooseStoneType) 3.1 Metal Ores - Normal Mines 3.2 Metal Ores - Dangerous Mines 3.3 Metal ores  Quarry levels 3.4 Other ores 4 Items 5 Large Resources 6 Terrain Features 7 Area Uniques 8 Ore Clumps 8.1 Ores From Rocks 9 References Populate Levels The main code for populating the floor is found in the function StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::populateLevel. In setting up to populate the floor, it initially defines a stoneChance as a random number (double) in the range [10,30), monsterChance as a random number in the range [0.002, 0.022), itemChance as 0.0025 and gemStoneChance as 0.003. It then calls StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::adjustLevelChances, which will perform a few modifications including (in order)[3]: For floor 1, setting all bar stone chance to 0. For levels divisible by 5, setting the item and gemstone chance to 0; and setting monster chance to 0 for floors divisible by 10. For infested floors, setting the stoneChance and gemStoneChance to 0, monsterChance to 0.025 and itemChance to 0.001 increasing monsterChance by 0.02 for each level of difficulty. (This allows monsters to spawn on level 1. Other checks prevent it on levels divisible by 10) Setting monsterChance to 0 or doubling it if the appropriate buffs are active. Dividing gem stone chance by 2. Mofidying chances if is a quarry level so gemStoneChance is 0.001 (which has no effect as these floors cannot generate gem stone ore), itemChance is 0.0001, stoneChance is twice what it was previously so now it is in the range [20, 60) and the monster chance is 0.02 If you are in area 40 (floors 40 to 69), and the mine is difficult, it will scale monsterChance by a factor of 0.6600000262260437 After this setup, if the floor is not divisible by 10, it will then iterate through every square of the floor, and if it is clear for a mine object it will first try to add a stone (using stoneChance), then a monster (using monsterChance), then an item (using itemChance), then a large resource (2 by 2, see details below). If a large resource is generated, it will block the 3 tiles around it. Additionally, some monsters will spawn partners, which can also block nearby tiles resulting in less stone than expected. After iterating through all squares, it attempts to add area uniques (weeds) using the function StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::tryToAddAreaUniques, tries to spawn extra monsters (possibly replacing stones, up to one 35th of the total stones on the level) and then it attempts to add ore clumps using the function StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::tryToAddOreClumps, but only if the floor is greater than 2 and not divisible by 5. If the floor is divisible by 10, then it wont add anything except the ladder down and chest if needed. Mine Area The Mine area is based upon which floor you are on, with the exception of quarry levels. Quarry levels have an area of 77377. Floors 0-10 have an area of 0. Floors 11-29 have an area of 10. Floors 30-39 have an area of 0. Floors 40-79 have an area of 40. Floors 80-120 have an area of 80. Random ore placement (stoneChance and chooseStoneType) The game goes through 3 stages, first if the mine area is 40, there is a 15% chance for the stone to be either an ice crystal (319, 320, 321), or if the mines are set to dangerous and it is between floor 41 and 69, then it will be a weed (313, 314, 315). Then it checks if it is a mushroom floor, and if so there is a 55% chance to not generate a stone and 25% of the time it doesn't it will generate a mushroom, being a purple mushroom 20% of the time and a red mushroom otherwise. If it fails the weed check, and the 55% chance on a mushroom floor (or isn't a mushroom floor), it then uses the function StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::chooseStoneType, passing the gemstone chance from above and the magic numbers 0.001 and 5e-5 for gem nodes (internally chanceForPurpleStone) and mystic stones (internally chanceForMysticStone) to determine what stone to place. This code first checks for radioactive ore, then through each mine area for metal ores, then for other ores. This means overall on a mushroom floor, not in area 40, the default stone has a 45% chance of becoming a stone, a 2.75% chance of becoming a purple mushroom, a 11% chance of becoming a red mushroom, and a 41.25% chance of being nothing; and in area 40 the default stone has a 15% chance of becoming a weed, a 38.25% chance of becoming a stone, a 2.3375% chance of becoming a purple mushroom, a 9.35% chance of becoming a red mushroom, and a 35.0625% chance of being nothing. The below calculations and graphs will include weeds in area 40, but not mushroom floors. Metal Ores - Normal Mines An extract of the code for the normal mines (difficulty 0) is below. It goes through each area, setting a default stone, and then checking for ore. Note that after this it will add 1 to the whichStone variable if it is odd, which has the effect of changing the normal rock for the area. 	if (this.getMineArea() == 0 || this.getMineArea() == 10) {
whichStone = this.mineRandom.Next(31, 42);
if (this.mineLevel % 40 < 30 && whichStone >= 33 && whichStone < 38) {
whichStone = ((this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5) ? 32 : 38);
} else if (this.mineLevel % 40 >= 30) {
whichStone = ((this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5) ? 34 : 36);
}
if (this.mineLevel != 1 && this.mineLevel % 5 != 0 && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.029) {
return new Object(tile, 751, "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false) //Copper
}
} else if (this.getMineArea() == 40) {
whichStone = this.mineRandom.Next(47, 54);
if (this.mineLevel % 5 != 0 && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.029) {
return new Object(tile, 290, "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false) //Iron
}
} else if (this.getMineArea() == 80) {
whichStone = ((this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.3 && !this.isDarkArea()) ? ((!(this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5)) ? 32 : 38) : ((this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.3) ? this.mineRandom.Next(55, 58) : ((!(this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5)) ? 762 : 760)));
if (this.mineLevel % 5 != 0 && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.029) {
return new Object(tile, 764, "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false)//Gold
}
}
In each area, there is a 2.9% chance for the stone to be ore, with the ore selected matching the area (copper below floor 40, iron between floor 40 and 80, and gold above that). However, the floor must not be divisible by 5, and cannot be floor 1. Also, if it is in area 40, there is a 15% chance it wont reach this point, bringing the total chance for iron ore from random stones down to 2.465%. If it is a metal ore, the function returns. Otherwise it continues to determine if it should be one of the other ores (e.g. diamond ore node), discussed below. While there are many different types for normal rocks, they can be divided into 2 broad types: those with the index 40 or 42, and the rest. These types affect the likelihood of obtaining ore when breaking the rock (see below). If the type is 40 or 42 it has a multiplier of 1.2; otherwise it has a multiplier of 0.8. The only floors these high ore chance rock can occur on are 1-29. On these floors there is a 3 in 11 chance 27% of being a high ore chance rock. Metal Ores - Dangerous Mines The first step is to check if the stone should be radioactive ore, with the following check: if (this.GetAdditionalDifficulty() > 0 && this.mineLevel % 5 != 0 && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < (double)this.GetAdditionalDifficulty() * 0.001 + (double)((float)this.mineLevel / 100000f) + Game1.player.team.AverageDailyLuck() / 13.0 + Game1.player.team.AverageLuckLevel() * 0.0001500000071246177)
For this, the luck boost from the special charm (0.025, contribution to AverageDailyLuck) is equivalent to an additional 192.3 floors (2500/13), making radioactive ore more likely on floor 1 with a special charm than floor 100 without it. A single point of luck (such as from a food buff) is worth ~15 floors. With the best possible luck 1.2% of stones will be radioactive ore. With the worst possible luck no radioactive ore will appear in the mines at all, and the worst possible daily luck would require a luck buff of 24 along with the special charm to be able to have any chance to find radioactive ore. Also note that radioactive ore will not appear on any floor divisible by 5. If the mines are doubly difficult (Qi quest "Danger in the Deep" while the Shrine of Challenge is active), it will contribute an extra 0.1%. This is not used in the below calculations. After this, it will go through the different areas, picking a default stone, and checking for ores, returning if one is found. 	if (this.getMineArea() == 0 || this.getMineArea() == 10) {
whichStone = this.mineRandom.Next(33, 37);
if (Game1.random.NextDouble() < 0.33) {
whichStone = 846; //Stone ore
} else {
stoneColor = new Color(Game1.random.Next(60, 90), Game1.random.Next(150, 200), Game1.random.Next(190, 240));
}
if (this.isDarkArea()) { //Level 30+
whichStone = this.mineRandom.Next(32, 39);
int tone = Game1.random.Next(130, 160);
stoneColor = new Color(tone, tone, tone);
}
if (this.mineLevel != 1 && this.mineLevel % 5 != 0 && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.029) {
return new Object(tile, 849, "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false) { //Copper

};
}
if (stoneColor.Equals(Color.White)) { //Only happens for stone ore on floors less than 30. Otherwise stone colour is changed.
return new Object(tile, whichStone, "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false) {
MinutesUntilReady = stoneHealth

}
if (this.mineLevel != 1 && this.mineLevel % 5 != 0 && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.029) {

}
}
This has the same 2.9% chance check for ore as for the regular mines, however there are some significant differences. Firstly there was the chance for them to be replaced by radioactive ore, which depends heavily on luck. On floors 1-39, there is a 33% chance for it to set the normal stone type to stone ore; if it is less than level 30, and it doesn't return copper ore, it will return this stone ore. This gives a 32% chance to return stone ore. On floors 41-69, there is a 15% chance to return a twig instead of a stone. This means that overall (assuming no radioactive ore) on floors 41-69, 15% of the "random stones" will be weeds, 12.75% of the time they will be twigs, 2.1% of the time they will be iron, and 70.2% of the time they will be something else. Also, on floors 41-69, the rocks that spawn will be more likely to drop ore when broken, the rocks on other floors will be less likely to drop ore. Metal ores  Quarry levels Quarry levels are treated as a special case, after checking for radioactive ore if the mines are dangerous, it then goes through the following (abridged) code. These probabilities are defined in the following code:     bool foundSomething = false;
foreach (Vector2 v in Utility.getAdjacentTileLocations(tile)) {
if (base.objects.ContainsKey(v)) {
foundSomething = true;
break;
}
}
if (!foundSomething && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.45) {
return null;
}
bool brownSpot = false;
for (int i = 0; i < this.brownSpots.Count; i++) {
if (Vector2.Distance(tile, this.brownSpots[i]) < 4f) {
brownSpot = true;
break;
}
if (Vector2.Distance(tile, this.brownSpots[i]) < 6f) {
return null;
}
}
if (brownSpot) {
whichStone = ((this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5) ? 32 : 38);
if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.01) {
return new Object(tile, 751, "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false) //copper
}
} else {
whichStone = ((this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5) ? 34 : 36);
if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.01) {
return new Object(tile, 290, "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false) //iron
}
}
return new Object(tile, whichStone, "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false) // normal rock
Regardless of what options are taken, this will return. This means it isn't possible to have a quarry level with gem nodes, mystic stones, or ores for gems, as they are determined after checking areas. If there isn't an adjacent stone to the location being considered, there is a 45% chance that this will return nothing. However, as the stone chance was multiplied by 2 when adjusting level chances, this doesn't result in less stone on these levels. The brown spots are generated in StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::loadLevel, where it will randomly place brown spots so that 1% of the total map area are brown spots. Technically it is possible for these to be the same square, or for these to be outside the map and have no effect. If it is within 4 tiles of a brown spot, there is a 1% chance for copper ore, and a 99% chance to be a normal, brown coloured rock. If it is 6 or more tiles away from a brown spot, there is a 1% chance for iron ore, and a 99% chance to be a normal, grey coloured rock. (Not the dark grey rocks which are stone ores) Otherwise, if it is within 6 tiles, but outside 4 tiles, there will be no rocks. This means that multiple brown spots can connect, but there should be a gap between brown rocks and grey rocks. Other ores Other than for radioactive ore up until this point, luck has not factored into the calculation, and level has only affected what area is used and removed ores on floors divisible by 5. However, if it does not return an ore or stone above (or null for a quarry), it moves on to gemstone ores, dark grey rocks (stone ore), purple stones and mystic stones. This is done in the following complex code (code related to colour removed for simplicity, it will return a coloured object instead of an object):     double averageDailyLuck = Game1.player.team.AverageDailyLuck(Game1.currentLocation);
double averageMiningLevel = Game1.player.team.AverageSkillLevel(3, Game1.currentLocation);
double chanceModifier = averageDailyLuck + averageMiningLevel * 0.005;
// Diamond node.
if (this.mineLevel > 50 && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.00025 + (double)this.mineLevel / 120000.0 + 0.0005 * chanceModifier / 2.0) {
whichStone = 2;
stoneHealth = 10;
}
// Gem stone nodes.
else if (gemStoneChance != 0.0 && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < gemStoneChance + gemStoneChance * chanceModifier + (double)this.mineLevel / 24000.0) {
return new Object(tile, this.getRandomGemRichStoneForThisLevel(this.mineLevel), "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false) {
MinutesUntilReady = 5
};
}
// gem node (purple rocks).
if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < chanceForPurpleStone / 2.0 + chanceForPurpleStone * averageMiningLevel * 0.008 + chanceForPurpleStone * (averageDailyLuck / 2.0)) {
whichStone = 44;
}
// Mystic stones.
if (this.mineLevel > 100 && this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < chanceForMysticStone + chanceForMysticStone * averageMiningLevel * 0.008 + chanceForMysticStone * (averageDailyLuck / 2.0)) {
whichStone = 46;
}
whichStone += whichStone % 2;
// Dark grey rock (stone ore).
if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.1 && this.getMineArea() != 40) {
return new Object(tile, (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5) ? 668 : 670, "Stone", canBeSetDown: true, canBeGrabbed: false, isHoedirt: false, isSpawnedObject: false)
{
MinutesUntilReady = 2,
Flipped = (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5)
};
}
return new Object(); //Return selected stone
Changing distribution of diamond nodes with floor, luck and mining level Before analyzing in full, it is worth noting the impact of luck. Diamonds and Gemstones both use chanceModifier. As daily luck ranges from a minimum of -0.1 to a maximum of 0.125 (with the special charm), and farmer level ranges from 0 to 14, the lowest this can be is -0.1, and the highest is 0.195. For diamonds this is multiplied by 0.0005 and divided by 2 making its effect range from -0.0025% to 0.004875%, or by approximately 0.007%, equivalent to 8.85 floors. For a farmer with the special charm and level 10 mining, the range is reduced to 0.005%, equivalent to 6.6 floors. This is also quite small compared to the base of 0.126% for floor 1 with 0 luck and 0 mining levels. For gemstone ores, the range works out to be 0.044% for the entire range, or 0.033% for the reduced range; equivalent to 10.62 and 7.92 floors, and still small compared to the 0.654% at floor 1. The chance for gem nodes and mystic stones don't directly use the floor, and the multiplier for the chance is used in all parts of the calculation. Now the range for averageDailyLuck/2 (0.1125) is quite large, over 20% of the base 0.5 chance, making this much more dependent upon luck. Likewise, the 14 levels from mining contribute 0.112, over 10%, but the 4 gained from food buffs only contribute 0.032, much less significant. Likewise, for Mystic Stones the contribution from luck is over 10% of the base of 1, with the mining levels having a similarly reduced impact. This can be better understood by considering the exit points. The first way to return from this function is by failing the diamond check and passing the gem stone check. The second way is if it fails the above, but passes the dark grey rock check. Otherwise it exits as whatever stone it was last set to (so mystic first, then purple, then diamond, then regular stone). This can be understood as (where each check is if they pass the check for meeting the chance):    if (!diamondCheck && gemCheck){
return gem
}
if (stoneCheck) {
return grey rock
}
if (mysticCheck) {
return mystic stone
}
if (purpleCheck) {
return gem node
}
if (diamondCheck) {
return diamond
}
return rock
However the use of diamondCheck twice means you cannot just use the chance for it twice, as it will either pass both times or fail both times, making calculations of chances more complex. The simplest to understand is the gemstone ore. In order to return the gemstone ore, the diamond check must fail, and the gem check must pass. This is equivalent to:    (1-chanceForOre)*(1-chanceForDiamond)*chanceForGem.
Additionally, this returns a random gem using the function MineShaft::getRandomGemRichStoneForThisLevel[4]. This relies upon the code:     int whichGem = this.mineRandom.Next(59, 70);
whichGem += whichGem % 2;
if (Game1.player.timesReachedMineBottom == 0) {
if (level < 40 && whichGem != 66 && whichGem != 68) {
whichGem = ((this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5) ? 66 : 68);
}
else if (level < 80 && (whichGem == 64 || whichGem == 60)) {
whichGem = ((!(this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5)) ? ((this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5) ? 68 : 62) : ((this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.5) ? 66 : 70));
}
}
Which will randomly select an integer in the range [59,70), and then add 1 if it is odd. This has the effect of randomly selecting an even integer from 60 to 70 inclusive, with the integers from 60 to 68 inclusive having an equal likelihood and 70 being half as likely. This is because the mineRandom.Next(a,b) will return an integer greater than or equal to a and less than b, from internally generating a random number from 0 to 1, scaling it and offsetting it to be a random decimal number from 59 to 70, and then rounding down. This means that the range 59 to just below 61 will round to 59 or 60, which is then both forced to 60; while the numbers from 69 to 70 will round to 69 and then be converted to 70, meaning 70 has half the range. This means that the chance for jade (from 70) will be one 11th of the chance to obtain a gem, and the other gems (emerald, aquamarine, ruby, amethyst & topaz) will be double that:       jade = (1-chanceForDiamond)*chanceForGem/11
other = (1-chanceForDiamond)*chanceForGem*2/11
However, if you have not yet reached the bottom of the mines, and the floor generated is less than floor 80, this distribution will be different. Until floor 40 there is an equal chance for amethyst or topaz. Between floor 40 and floor 80 there is a complex chance where the chance for emerald and ruby are replaced with amethyst, topaz, aquamarine and jade; this results in an 18.2% chance for jade, and a 27.3% chance for each of amethyst, topaz and aquamarine. The chance to not be a gem stone ore, and be some other option (other than diamond) relies upon either passing the diamond check, or failing the diamond check and failing the gemstone check. This chance is equal to:    chanceForDiamond+(1-chanceForDiamond)*(1-chanceForGem) = 1-(1-chanceForDiamond)*chanceForGem
Then going through each return statement we have the final chances being:   stoneore = (1-(1-chanceForDiamond)*chanceForGem)*chanceForStone
mystic = (1-(1-chanceForDiamond)*chanceForGem)*(1-chanceForStone)*chanceForMystic
purple = (1-(1-chanceForDiamond)*chanceForGem)*(1-chanceForStone)*(1-chanceForMystic)*chanceForPurple
The next one to consider is is Diamond. As passing the diamond check skips the gem stone ore check, so it cannot be included in the chance. To be a diamond, it must pass the diamond check, which skips the gem check, and it must fail every other check. This gives:    diamond = (chanceForDiamond)*(1-chanceForPurple)*(1-chanceForMystic)*(1-chanceForStone)
While calculated in quite a different way, the chance to find a diamond node is quite comparable to the chance to find a node of another gem type. And finally, the only other option is a normal rock. This could be calculated as whatever is left over, but for completeness, it must fail every check.       rock = (1-chanceForDiamond)*(1-chanceForGem)*(1-chanceForPurple)*(1-chanceForMystic)*(1-chanceForStone)
Due to the interaction between the different checks it is hypothetically possible for the chance for one of these to be found increasing to decrease the chance of finding others. This is observed with the increasing chance to find mystic stones on floor 100 reducing the chance to find gem nodes and gem stone ores. Additionally, the increase in chance of finding these valuable items due to luck or mining level reduces the chance of finding dark grey rocks and rocks, but does not parasitically affect each other, e.g. a higher daily luck will increase your chance of finding diamonds, gems, mystic stones and gem nodes, and will decrease the chance of finding dark grey rocks and normal rocks. Items After checking for stones and monsters, it attempts to add items. The chance to succeed is the itemChance defined above. By default this is 0.25%, but it is 0.1% for infested floors and 0.01% for quarry floors. This calls the function StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::getRandomItemForThisLevel[5] to determine the item, using the following code (uneeded parts for skull Cavern removed) 	int index = 80;
if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.05 && level > 80) {
index = 422;
} else if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.1 && level > 20 && this.getMineArea() != 40) {
index = 420;
} else if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.25 || this.GetAdditionalDifficulty() > 0) {
switch (this.getMineArea()) {
case 0:

if (this.GetAdditionalDifficulty() > 0 && !this.isDarkArea()) {
switch (this.mineRandom.Next(6)) {

case 3:
index = 372;

}
if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.005) {
index = 797;
} else if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.08) {
index = 394;
}
} else {
index = 86;
}
break;
case 40:
if (this.GetAdditionalDifficulty() > 0 && this.mineLevel % 40 < 30) {
switch (this.mineRandom.Next(4)) {
case 0:
case 3:
index = 259;
break;
case 1:
index = 404;
break;
case 2:
index = 420;

}
if (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.08) {

First the item is set to 80 (quartz) which will be returned if all other checks fail. Then, if the floor is greater than 80, there is a 5% chance for it to return a purple mushroom. Otherwise, if the floor is greater than 20, it isn't area 40, there is a 10% chance to return a red mushroom. Otherwise there is a 25% chance to return an item based upon the area, or a 100% chance if the mines are set to difficult. Otherwise it will return quartz. For a quarry floor, there is no area item, so it will return a mushroom or quartz. In areas 0 and 10, if the mines are not set to dangerous or it is above floor 30, the item will be an earth crystal. If the mines are dangerous and it is below floor 30, the area item will be a pearl 0.5% of the time, otherwise a rainbow shell 8% of the time, otherwise there is a 5/6th chance for it to be one of seaweed, coral, sea urchin, clam or a nautilus shell; the remaining 1/6th will be nothing, ending up with the default quartz. For area 40, the item based upon area will be a frozen tear if the mines are not set to dangerous or it is above floor 70, otherwise there is a 50% chance to be a fiddlehead fern, a 25% chance to be a common mushroom and a 25% chance to be a red mushroom, with an 8% chance to be overridden by a purple mushroom. In area 80, the area based item is fire quartz. Floors Item Chances Dangerous Mine Item Chances Quarry 1-19 100% quartz 100% quartz Quarry 21-79 10% red mushroom 90% quartz 10% red mushroom 90% quartz Quarry 81-119 5% purple mushroom 9.5% red mushroom 85.5% quartz 5% purple mushroom 9.5% red mushroom 85.5% quartz 1-19 25% earth crystal 75% quartz 0.5% pearl 7.96% rainbow shell 15.257% seaweed 15.257% coral 15.257% sea urchin 15.257% clam 15.257% nautilus shell 15.257% quartz 21-29 10% red mushroom 22.5% earth crystal 67.5% quartz 10% red mushroom 0.45% pearl 7.164% rainbow shell 13.731% seaweed 13.731% coral 13.731% sea urchin 13.731% clam 13.731% nautilus shell 13.731% quartz 31-39 10% red mushroom 22.5% earth crystal 67.5% quartz 10% red mushroom 90% earth crystal 41-69 25% frozen tear 75% quartz 92% fiddlehead fern 46% common mushroom 46% red mushroom 8% purple mushroom 71-79 25% frozen tear 75% quartz 100% frozen tear 81-120 5% purple mushroom 9.5% red mushroom 21.375% fire quartz 64.125% quartz 5% purple mushroom 9.5% red mushroom 85.5% fire quartz Large Resources After checking for stones, monsters and items, it attempts to add resource clumps. This has a 0.5% chance to succeed (significantly smaller after considering above checks), and requires the mines to not be set to difficult, or for the floor to be in the range 41-69. Due to the order of iteration, this will not be stopped by a stone in one of the other 3 tiles needed for the large resource, instead it can block a stone which otherwise would have been added. Additionally, these will not generate on infested floors. The specific resource added will depend on area (40 or not) and mine difficulty: If the mine is difficult, it will add either a tree stump 90% of the time or fallen log 10% of the time. Otherwise, if it is in area 40, it will add one of 2 large blue rocks (to match the level theme) Otherwise, it will add one of the 2 other large rocks. Terrain Features If the mine is set to dangerous, then additional terrain features can be added. This occurs after checking for stones, monsters, items and large resources. If the floor is between 40 and 70, then there is a 1% chance to generate a mahogany tree. Otherwise there is a 10% chance to add grass if the floor is between 40 and 70, or above 80. Area Uniques In the StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::tryToAddAreaUniques[6], it will attempt to add "weeds". Before going further in, it checks conditions with: 	if ((this.getMineArea() != 10 && this.getMineArea() != 80 && (this.getMineArea() != 40 || !(this.mineRandom.NextDouble() < 0.1))) || this.isDarkArea() || this.mustKillAllMonstersToAdvance())
{
return;
}
This means it will only add weeds for floors 11-29 and 41-119, however on floors 41-39, there is only a 90% chance that it will try. Additionally, there is a later check for the mines being dangerous and the area being 80, causing it to return before adding weeds. If it is area 40 and the mine is not dangerous, or if it is dangerous and on floors 71-79, the "weeds" chosen is an ice crystal (319, 320 and 321). It will then make a random number of tries between 7 and 23 (inclusive) to place weeds. As this requires the spot to be free and in the accessible area, on average there will be fewer weeds placed, but if all tiles were free, this would give an average of 15 clumps of weeds (or ice crystals). This would give an average of less than 13.5 clumps in area 40. However, this does not necessarily mean that there will be fewer weeds (or ice crystals) in area 40. This is because in the "stone" generation, area 40 would have 15% of "stones" generate as single weeds (or ice crystals). This means that roughly 3% of suitable squares will be weeds in area 40 before the additional weed placement. Ore Clumps In the StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::tryToAddOreClumps[7] function, a try will only be made if a random number is less than 0.55 plus the average daily luck. The maximum possible average daily luck is 0.1 from random luck and 0.025 from the special charm[8]. This means with neutral luck there is a 55% chance to try, and with the best possible luck there is a 67.5% chance. It will try once, and then generate a random number and keep going if that random number is less than 0.25 plus the average daily luck. This means there will be 1 chance, plus a 25% chance with neutral luck or a 37.5% chance with best possible luck. This gives an expected value of 1.3 recurring or 1.6 attempts to generate a clump, which when combined with the base chance to try gives an expected amount of 0.67 or 1. However, each try chooses a random tile on the map and will only place an ore clump there if the tile is free, resulting in less than these numbers. But if successful, it will then have the possibility to expand outwards to cover multiple tiles with the ore. To choose which type of ore to add it calls the function StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::getAppropriateOre[9]. In this function it sets the default to 751 (copper ore) and then modifies it based upon mine area. If it is area 0 or 10, and the mines are difficult, it will change it to 849, a different type of copper ore. For area 40, if it is difficult it will be iron, otherwise, 80% of the time it will be iron. For area 80, 80% of the time it will be gold. Then just before returning if it is not area 40 and not difficult, then there is a 25% chance to set the ore to 668 or 670, which are the dark grey rocks (stone ore). This results in the following chances for the regular mines: For floors 3-39 and quarry floors, 25% chance to be stone, 75% chance to be copper. For floors 41-79, 80% chance to be iron, 20% chance to be copper. For floors 81-119, 25% chance to be stone, 60% chance to be gold, and 15% chance to be copper. This results in the following chances for the dangerous mines: For floors 3-39 and quarry floors, 100% chance to be copper. For floors 41-79, 100% chance to be iron. For floors 81-119, 80% chance to be gold, and 20% chance to be copper. Ores From Rocks If a normal rock is generated, there is still a chance to obtain ore from it. When the rock is broken, the code in StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::checkStoneForItems will potentially call StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::getOreIndexForLevel to have ore drop. The key parts of the code are[10]:     double chanceModifier = who.DailyLuck / 2.0 + (double)who.MiningLevel * 0.005 + (double)who.LuckLevel * 0.001;
double oreModifier = ((tileIndexOfStone == 40 || tileIndexOfStone == 42) ? 1.2 : 0.8);
if (r.NextDouble() < 0.05 * (1.0 + chanceModifier) * oreModifier) {
if (r.NextDouble() < 0.25 * (double)((!who.professions.Contains(21)) ? 1 : 2)) {
Game1.createObjectDebris(382, x, y, who.UniqueMultiplayerID, this); //coal
}
Game1.createObjectDebris(this.getOreIndexForLevel(this.mineLevel, r), x, y, who.UniqueMultiplayerID, this);//ore
} else if (r.NextDouble() < 0.5) {
Game1.createDebris(14, x, y, 1, this);
}
This results in a chance to find ore of 5.1% at worst, and 5.7% at best; with a corresponding 47.45% to 47.15% chance to obtain stone. If it would generate ore, then there is a 25% chance to obtain coal, doubled to 50% with the Prospector profession. This results in approximately a 1% chance to get coal from a rock. Then inside StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::getOreIndexForLevel, the following code is run to obtain the ore[11]: 	if (this.getMineArea(mineLevel) == 77377) { //Quarry levels
return 380; //Iron
}
if (mineLevel < 40) {
if (mineLevel >= 20 && r.NextDouble() < 0.1) {
return 380; //Iron
}
return 378; //Copper
}
if (mineLevel < 80) {
if (mineLevel >= 60 && r.NextDouble() < 0.1) {
return 384; //Gold
}
if (!(r.NextDouble() < 0.75)) {
return 378; //Copper
}
return 380; //Iron
}
if (mineLevel < 120) {
if (!(r.NextDouble() < 0.75)) {

The Wilderness Farm encourages Combat (but only gives 1/3 Combat experience for it). The Four Corners Farm offers perks from other maps and encourages Multiplayer. The Beach Farm offers extra items and encourages Fishing and Foraging, but discourages Farming late game. The Meadowlands Farm encourages Farming, specifically raising animals, and comes with two chickens by default. The interior of the farmhouse is decorated to match the theme of the chosen map.

Tried a different browser, same issue. Other pages that I've looked at so far are fine. Techhat (talk) 02:12, 25 January 2023 (UTC) Try refreshing the page, or switching to "Desktop" view and then back. The wiki remembers your settings for some pages (for example, when I test mobile view on one page, some other pages will also display in mobile view, but not all of them.) Also make sure your "Preferences" are set to "Vector" and not "MinervaNeue". margotbean (talk) 14:34, 25 January 2023 (UTC) I hadn't actually tested on mobile; this was on a desktop browser. I checked on my phone, and non-desktop mode shows the correct template. When I switch to desktop mode, it goes back to the wrong template. I had tested on both Chrome and Chromium on my PC and they both exhibited the same issue, with cleared cache and cookies. I also checked in empty profiles in Firefox and Edge (both on PC) and they both exhibit the same issue. Techhat (talk) 14:43, 25 January 2023 (UTC) Ok, when I open any wiki page in an incognito tab (using Chrome browser on a desktop), then click "mobile view", the skin is MinervaNeue. That shouldn't happen. I'll let the server people know. Thanks! margotbean (talk) 15:02, 25 January 2023 (UTC) The server people are working on a fix, but for now, you can purge the page, and that should make it display correctly. Just click in the url bar in your browser, and go to the end of the address, then type (or copy/paste) ?action=purge, then hit "enter". Hope this helps! margotbean (talk) 18:28, 8 February 2023 (UTC) Display problem of the german version of the homepage Good day all, since some time the German version of the homepage makes some display errors left missing the background frame and overlaps with the text of the post and top in the header is the display not quite right. I have made a screenshot of it: BigLink (talk) 04:53, 18 March 2023 I will inform the server people of the problem. In the meantime, you can use the Google Chrome browser, or sign in to your account, and make sure to check the box that says "keep me signed in". The issue only appears to affect users who aren't signed in. Thanks for reporting this! margotbean (talk) 16:07, 18 March 2023 (UTC) Update -- the server people have fixed the issue. Please report back if it happens again. Thank you, margotbean (talk) 17:38, 18 March 2023 (UTC) I see the same thing on the English wiki, but only when not logged-in. = Paul2520 (talk) 16:02, 8 May 2023 (UTC) Thank you, I've reported it to the server people. margotbean (talk) 17:59, 8 May 2023 (UTC) AbuseFilters 7 and 8 I've noticed you've used those filters to make makeshift title and username blacklists. Because AbuseFilter runs on every action, these would be better served by MediaWikiWiki:Extension:TitleBlacklist. (That said, I'm sure that 2 extra AbuseFilters running on your 30-ish daily actions is causing dozens of bytes of additional RAM to be consumed on your server hardware. :P) Snowmanonahoe (talk) 20:55, 19 May 2023 (UTC) The images are being really weird This hasn't always been this way but I don't know when it started Hello dear Admin. I'm not sure what's going on but this has been happening for months however it hasn't always been like this. I can't remember when it started but it's been at least I believe six months. I thought it could have been my extentions but I tested and it wasn't. I'm using Opera GX and I checked with Google and this didn't happen. Could it be Opera GX interacting in some way? Is it a glitch? The only way I can describe it is that it looks like black and white were inverted and maybe the color contrast was cranked up. Any idea how to fix this if it's not a bug? Tiptoe50 (talk) 17:47, 4 June 2023 Check your browser extensions for something labeled "dark theme" or with the word "dark" in it, and disable it. Or, turn off "Force dark pages" in Advanced settings. If that doesn't work, I can't help you. Send feedback to the developers of the browser asking for help, and you might find more useful tips. margotbean (talk) 23:02, 4 June 2023 (UTC) Vandalism I don't know if it's necessary to report it or not, but User:Mike. vandalized the Ginger Island page. I have edited it out. IntricateSpiral (talk) 16:28, 6 August 2023 (UTC) Hello IntricateSpiral! It's not necessary to report all instances of vandalism, but thank you for cleaning up!! margotbean (talk) 19:43, 6 August 2023 (UTC) Need to update the image showing the version on the homepage The homepage has an image at the top saying "Stardew Valley 1.5". It is now 1.6. I have attached another image with the 1.6 version from Concerned Ape's blog if you want to use that. Trying to update mystery box page I was trying to edit the contents on the Mystery Box page to be in charts like how the geode content tables are organized, but I got the pop-up that it was too big of an edit for a new editor to make. I don't know if this is the best way to alert someone that I am trying to do this genuinely, or if someone here can even grant me the permission to make that edit. If someone else has to make the edit, that's understandable, but I was really excited to do it! RaeOSunshine24 (talk) 20:48, 25 March 2024 (UTC) Don't know how to solve this but just curious on your approach, have you considered a table like Treasure Chests as well? Or you like to split it like Geode like you mentioned? YuvixAdun (talk) 21:17, 25 March 2024 (UTC) My first instinct was to have the items split into multiple charts because there are so many different categories of items (crafting, clothing, special items, recipes, etc.) but I'm not married to it! This has just been a cool outlet for me to kind of learn coding related to something I'm very interested in. Any help or advice is appreciated :) RaeOSunshine24 (talk) 22:23, 25 March 2024 (UTC) I changed my approach and am now trying to adjust it just so it matches the content chart on the Golden Mystery Box page, but that's still too big of an edit apparently :( again, someone else is welcome to do it, I just find the current way it's organized hard to read! RaeOSunshine24 (talk) 12:26, 26 March 2024 (UTC) Unable to confirm email address I have recently made an account for this wiki, but it seems like the email confirmation is broken, as it never sent me an email and every time I try to have it send one or I replace the email I get the following error code: "Stardew Valley Wiki could not send your confirmation mail. Please check your email address for invalid characters. Mailer returned: Failed to send data [SMTP: Invalid response code received from server (code: 554, response: Message rejected: Sending paused for this account. For more information, please check the inbox of the email address associated with your AWS account.)] " It has been hours since I first tried to confirm my email, but it has sent nothing. I am positive I entered my email address correctly, it seems to be an issue with whatever sends the emails with the confirmation links. Same here. Gofer2x (talk) 11:45, 30 March 2024 (UTC) Request move of page Joja Catalogue Hi there, please move Joja Catalogue to Joja Furniture Catalogue  that's what it is called in game. :) Require Permissions to flesh out Wallpaper page I just attempted to flesh out the Wallpaper page to break up the giant table and indicate the sources of various wallpapers, including the two unobtainable wallpapers, but it was flagged as too large an edit for a new user. It would be much appreciated if I could have this restriction lifted somehow. Sicarious (talk) 08:25, 12 April 2024 (UTC) The restriction will be automatically lifted once you have made 25 edits, if I recall correctly. User314159 (talk) 16:06, 12 April 2024 (UTC) It's a bit more than that. Please read Help:Editing, and make changes to the page in smaller increments, saving in-between. Thanks, margotbean (talk) 18:43, 12 April 2024 (UTC) Okay, that got it to work, thanks. Had to break it up quite a bit more than expected, but it's all good now. I don't know if I should clean up this topic myself or not, so I'm just going to leave it for now.Sicarious (talk) 06:42, 13 April 2024 (UTC) Adding external links to Modding:Mod compatibility I am trying to edit the page of Modding:Mod compatibility and update the mods to their unofficial version that I found on github however I'm blocked because I'm adding external links. I've made more than a dozens of edits to contribute to this page which shares its data with smapi.com/mods for a lot of users. I tried copying the format of other mods who had "github.com" in their block of code but couldn't have my changes accepted as the format was impossible to mimic. I've encountered an automatic message to message moderator and when searching for that word i was directed to this section of the site, I hope this is the correct procedure to go In short I'd like a solution for a workaround or permission to add these two block of codes as replacement to the currently mods with the status broken (it might be better to view the text below in source code along with the mod page in source code on the side to understand better): comparison of the two version of code, the one I want to replace VS the outdated code currently present in the mod page {{#invoke:SMAPI compatibility|entry

Twister5798 (talk) 07:29, 15 April 2024 (UTC)Twister5798, 2024-04-15 Hi! We have link templates for a few whitelisted sites to avoid the spam filter. For example, {{github|perkmi/Always-On-Server-for-Multiplayer}} produces https://github.com/perkmi/Always-On-Server-for-Multiplayer. Pathoschild (talk) 19:37, 15 April 2024 (UTC) Request move of Dehydrator Productivity from user space Productivity information was removed from Dehydrator in edit Special:PermanentLink/168482. I've created separate pages in user space with that information to clean it up a bit and bring it in line with Keg Productivity pages. They're in a reasonable state to be published now and can be moved. The following pages can be moved: User:My hat stinks/Drafts/Dehydrator Productivity to Dehydrator Productivity User:My hat stinks/Drafts/Dehydrator Productivity - Tiller to Dehydrator Productivity - Tiller User:My hat stinks/Drafts/Dehydrator Productivity - Artisan to Dehydrator Productivity - Artisan After the move we should also set up a template Template:DehydratorProductivity-top to match Template:KegProductivity-top. Alternatively we can make a more general-purpose template since it breaks the rule of 3 (it's also used on Preserves Jar Productivity and presumably will be on Cask Productivity), but that's a separate discussion. My hat stinks (talk) 10:50, 23 April 2024 (UTC) When 1.6 is settled (meaning no more "balance changes" will be made) and you've explained what "5p" and "1p" are on the pages, and fixed the text that links to "Keg", then I will consider moving the pages. In the meantime, please avoid creating redlinks. I understand that was probably for my convenience, but it's not necessary. Thank you, margotbean (talk) 20:28, 23 April 2024 (UTC) "No more balance changes" is a literally impossible goal and not followed anywhere else on the wiki (i.e. every other 1.6 change is documented without contest), but I've made the other changes. It's worth noting that if this page was not in user space any user could make such improvements. My hat stinks (talk) 21:20, 23 April 2024 (UTC) It has been 8 minor revisions (including 4 balance changes affecting other areas documented on this wiki) since dehydrator balance was changed. What is your threshold for "no more balance changes", and why does it only apply to this page? Will this page not be editable in future? My hat stinks (talk) 08:30, 6 May 2024 (UTC) Version 1.6.9 is still in the works, but it seems to be bugfixes at this point. I see that you've corrected the things I mentioned. If you want to move the pages and make an attempt to create the new template in all 12 languages, you can move them to the main space. You can leave the template untranslated in the other languages, and add the appropriate "translate" template at the top, inside <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags. margotbean (talk) 16:38, 6 May 2024 (UTC) Making edits to Elliott's 14 heart event Hello! I couldn't figure out how to contact site admins directly so I'm making a post here. I wanted to update Elliott's 14 heart event with the contents of the six letters that he sends the player but it was blocked because it was a lot of text and my account is new. Is it possible to let me edit that section? Thank you! Smolpango (talk) 18:28, 28 April 2024 (UTC) Smolpango Hungarian wiki broken Hi, I don't know if you know this already, but for me there seems to be something wrong with the Hungarian wiki. The sidebar is overlapping the main text. Cheese80 (talk) 17:36, 1 May 2024 (UTC) Yes, I can see the problem when I open the tab "incognito" view. Does it happen when you're signed into the wiki? margotbean (talk) 21:02, 1 May 2024 (UTC) I've reported the problem (again) to the server people. This is a recurring problem, and the workaround is to sign in. I'll see if they can fix this problem (again!), and thanks for letting me know! margotbean (talk) 21:12, 1 May 2024 (UTC) It looks like it's now been fixed. Thanks for your help! Cheese80 (talk) 07:18, 2 May 2024 (UTC) Crop Growth Calendars for New 1.6 Crops: Agriculturist and Speed-Gro Comparison Hello, I'm not entirely sure how to contact administrators directly so I'm posting here. I did testing on all the new crops (Carrot, Summer Squash, Broccoli, and Powdermelon) and formatted everything to add to the Crop Growth Calendars page, but my edit was blocked as I'm a fairly new user. I have all 6 "sub-calendars" ready for all the crops and have the code written out ready to add in. Everything is in line with the existing formatting / layout and the preview looked perfect. I'd love to get these added for everyone to use but I'm assuming my account needs to be approved or something along those lines. I read the Help Editing page in advance and went out of my way to make a handful of minor edits and even made sure to add and verify my email before I tried adding these, but it seems that wasn't enough to allow me to add the calendars. I'm hoping this is the correct place to post this--please let me know what I need to do so I can get these added. Thank you so much!! KrobusFanClub (talk) 08:51, 6 May 2024 (UTC) I've uploaded a screenshot of the edit preview for the Powdermelon Crop Growth Calendars to show what I'm trying to add. I made more minor edits in an attempt to clear the threshold but I'm still unable to add these in. I'm not sure if there's a certain number of minor edits I need to hit, a time window I need to reach, or possibly both--all would make sense, and I completely understand why these limitations are in place! I just really want to add these calendars in so just let me know what I have to do on my end to make that possible. I'll mark that screenshot to delete as soon as I can get this resolved. Thanks again :) KrobusFanClub (talk) 12:25, 6 May 2024 (UTC) Hello KrobusFanClub! There's no magic box I can check for you, you simply have to keep making smaller edits and saving in-between. margotbean (talk) 16:42, 6 May 2024 (UTC) Makes sense, thanks for the response. Can I ask if there's a magic number I need to hit or should I just keep trying occasionally after making more edits? Also, is it best practice to remove these sections on this page once they're resolved, or should I leave it up? Sorry for the newbie questions, I appreciate you!! KrobusFanClub (talk) 05:26, 7 May 2024 (UTC) I was able to make the edits and add the calendars! There's a formatting "issue" that's bothering me for the Carrot tables but I've posted on the discussion page asking about that. Thank you so much for all your work maintaining this wiki, you are appreciated more than you know!!

Artisan Goods From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Artisan Goods are items that can be created using Artisan Equipment. They can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days (in-game time) to be processed. For most Artisan Goods, the star quality of the ingredients used is ignored. The only exceptions are Mayonnaise made from an Ostrich Egg, and Smoked Fish. For these products, the star quality of the artisan product will match that of the ingredient. Additionally, while Cloth does not have a star quality itself, it is affected by the quality of the Wool used, with higher quality wool resulting in higher chances to produce 2 cloth instead of 1. If the Artisan Profession is chosen after reaching level 10 Farming, Artisan Goods will be worth 40% more (with the exception of Oil and Coffee). Tree Syrups (Maple Syrup, Oak Resin, Pine Tar, and Mystic Syrup) do not benefit from the Artisan Profession, and are not included here. They are labeled as "Artisan Goods" in-game, however. (Their value is instead affected by the Tapper Profession.) One Artisan Good, the Piña Colada, can be obtained only from the Island Resort on Ginger Island on Sundays when Gus tends the bar there.

When the statue is right-clicked on, the scythe will be added to the tool set if the inventory is not full. If it is full, the player will get an "inventory full" message.

Skull Cavern/Ore Distribution From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Small minable stones and ores can appear as random stones throughout the floor, or rarely as small clumps. These have different distributions[1][2]. On average there will be less than 0.67 small resource clumps on each floor with neutral luck, and less than 1 for the largest possible luck. These clumps have a 25% chance to be a dark grey rock (stone ore), a 1.5% chance to be iridium, and a 73.5% chance to be gold. The distribution for random stones is more complex and varies with depth and best understood in a few stages. If a Qi quest is in progress which makes the mine more dangerous, there is a small chance for a stone to be replaced with a radioactive node. This is very dependent upon luck, with the luck boost from the special charm being worth 192 floors, and the worst luck requiring a depth of floor 550 to have any chance ore will drop. This is also dependent on luck buffs, with each level of luck worth 15 floors. This will replace any of the below stones. The chance for a stone to be a metal ore (copper, iron, gold, or iridium) will vary depending on floor, starting at 2% on floor 1, rapidly increasing to 16% on floor 100, and then increasing to 100% on floor 1780. Luck has no effect on this chance, or on the ore distribution. Copper and iron have the same distribution. From floor 2010 only gold and iridium ore will be found, and from floor 5700 only iridium ore will be found from this generation. If the stone is not a metal ore, there is a chance for it to be a a gem stone ore (diamond, emerald, aquamarine, ruby, amethyst, topaz, and jade), a gem node (the round purple stone), a mystic stone or a dark grey rock. This means that the chance can decrease as you go deeper as more of the stone is metal ore, and above floor 1780 these will not be found. Luck and mining level only play a significant role for mystic stones and gem nodes. For others the contribution is negligible. For gem stone ores, diamond is slightly rarer than most, and jade is twice as rare as most. The chance initially increases, peaking at a chance of ~0.35% (~0.18% for jade) at a depth of ~800, before dropping back down. Dark grey rocks, start with their maximum chance at floor 1 (9.73% for dark grey rocks, 0.005% for mystic stones, 0.059% for gem nodes for best chances), and drop proportionally as ores take their place. During the Desert Festival, there are some small changes to how the ore is generated, this is to allow the generation of Calico egg nodes. This occurs below in the section to generate ore clumps, and the section to generate metallic ores.

Tapper From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Tapper Place on a maple, oak, or pine tree and wait for the reservoir to fill with product! Information Source Crafting Season All Sell Price Cannot be sold Crafting Recipe Source Foraging (Level 4) Ingredients Wood (40) Copper Bar (2) This article is about the item. For the profession, see Skills#Foraging. The Tapper is a type of Refining Equipment that can be placed on a tree to produce Maple Syrup, Oak Resin, Pine Tar, Sap, or Mystic Syrup. It can also be placed on a Mushroom Tree to produce different mushrooms. It can also be placed on a Fern Green Rain Tree to produce Fiddlehead Ferns. Other types of Green Rain Tree cannot be tapped. When a tree has a Tapper on it, the tree is unable to be directly shaken (by interacting with it). However, if the tree is moss-covered, it will be shaken when you swing a scythe or weapon on the tree to remove the moss. The Tapper can be removed from a tree by hitting it once with an axe or pickaxe. This leaves the Tapper intact and able to be reused. If the Tapper is on a tree when it is struck by lightning or hit by an exploding bomb, both the Tapper and its contents are destroyed. During Winter, tappers placed on Maple Trees, Oak Trees, Pine Trees, Mahogany Trees, or Mystic Trees continue to produce; however since Mushroom Trees and Fern Green Rain Trees turn to stumps in Winter, tappers placed on them produce nothing during that season. The Tapper cannot be placed on Fruit Trees. Contents 1 Products 2 Types 3 References 4

Trout Derby From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. Trout Derby is a fishing mini festival that occurs on the 20th and 21st of Summer. The festival begins at 6:10am and ends at 2:00am on both days. The festival takes place in Cindersap Forest by the river near Marnie's Ranch. During the festival, players can fish in the river to catch Rainbow Trout, which can be caught all day long and regardless of weather. Each Rainbow Trout catch (from anywhere with the exception of from a Fish Pond) has a 33% chance to give the player a Golden Tag. This chance is multiplied by the number of Rainbow Trout caught, so it increases to 66% if 2 Rainbow Trout are caught at once and to 99% if 3 are caught at once.[1] Only 1 Golden Tag can be caught per catch even if the player caught multiple Rainbow Trout at once. When a Golden Tag is obtained, if the player did not get a Fishing Treasure Chest it will be caught with the fish itself. Otherwise it will be obtained with the treasure chest that appears while catching the Rainbow Trout. While Golden Tags can be obtained from Rainbow Trouts in other locations, with the exception of Farm Maps with Cindersap Forest fish (Riverland, Hilltop, Forest, and Meadowlands), Rainbow Trout can only be caught with their normal restrictions in these areas. Golden Tags can be exchanged for prizes at the booth. Golden Tags carry over from day to day and can be saved for subsequent years. Unlike other festivals, shops and homes throughout Stardew Valley are not closed on the days of the event, and time continues to pass during the festival. Animals also need to be fed during the event; the game will not automatically consider them to be fed.

Combat From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. Combat is the skill associated with fighting monsters, such as in The Mines or the Skull Cavern. Combat is increased by killing monsters, with more difficult monsters granting more experience. Each increase in Combat Level adds 5 HP (health points) to the player's health meter, with the exceptions of levels 5 and 10. Health points are only increased when levelling up to levels 5 or 10 if the Fighter and Defender professions are chosen. Level-ups may also add Crafting or Cooking recipes. Unlike other skills, there is no proficiency effect from this skill since weapons do not require energy. During the first few days in Stardew Valley, the Mines are closed due to an accident by Joja Corporation. On or around day 5, the player will receive a letter in the mail from Joja Corp, explaining that the landslide blocking the mines has been cleared, and the mine entrance will be open. At this point, combat becomes available to players. An exception is those who chose the Wilderness Farm, which starts with monsters at the first night. As with other skills, note that experience level is increased immediately upon slaying a monster, but the "level up" window doesn't appear until the player sleeps (or until all players sleep in multiplayer). Note that killing monsters on the Farm grants only 1/3 of the standard amount of experience.[1] Contents 1 Combat Skill 2 Experience Points 3 Substats 3.1 Critical hit chance 4 References 5

Keg Productivity - Artisan From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search No Profession Tiller Artisan This page lists the productivity of processing Fruits, Vegetables, Coffee Beans, and Honey into Artisan Goods in a Keg. The products produced usually sell for more than the raw input items, so using a Keg is almost always profitable. Items that lose gold are highlighted in red, and items whose net increase in value is zero are highlighted in orange. The profit made from processing items is lowest when using iridium quality and highest when using regular quality items. Beer, Mead, Pale Ale, and Wine can be aged in a Cask to further increase their profit. The table below shows profit for regular quality processed items only. This table shows the profitability of processing items when the player has chosen the Artisan Profession (note that the Tiller Profession is a prerequisite for the Artisan Profession so both are taken into account here). To view the profitability for no profession or the Tiller Profession, use the links at the top of the page. Note that the processing times for a Keg vary, depending on the item used. Beer = 1,750 minutes Coffee = 120 minutes Green Tea = 180 minutes Juice = 6,000 minutes Mead = 600 minutes Pale Ale = 2,250 minutes Wine = 10,000 minutes For items that take less than a day to process (e.g., Coffee), the table calculates maximum profit assuming the player continually harvests and refills the keg during a 1600 minute day.[1] Productivity (g/minute) = ([Processed Sell Price] - [Input Item Sell Price]) / Processing Time Approximate g/day = Productivity (g/minute) * 1600 [1] Note that you may click on a column header to sort the table by that column, then Shift+Click on a second column to perform a secondary sort.

Preserves Jar Productivity - Tiller From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search No Profession Tiller Artisan This page lists the productivity of processing Fruits, Vegetables, and Ginger into Jellies and Pickles and Roe into Aged Roe or Caviar in a Preserves Jar. The products produced usually sell for more than the raw input items, so using a Preserves Jar is almost always profitable. Items that lose gold are highlighted in red, and items whose net increase in value is zero are highlighted in orange. Jellies and Pickles are always regular quality, so the profit made from processing items is lowest when using iridium quality and highest when using regular quality items. This table shows the profitability of processing items when the player has chosen the Tiller Profession. To view the profitability for no profession, or the Artisan Profession, use the links at the top of the page. Note that the processing time for a Preserves Jar is always 4000 minutes, with one exception: Sturgeon Roe produces Caviar in 6000 minutes rather than 4000.

Dried Fruit From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. Dried Fruit Chewy pieces of dried fruit. Information Source Artisan Goods Sell Price 7.5 × Fruit Base Price + 25 Artisan Goods Equipment Dehydrator Processing Time 1750m (?1d) Ingredients Any Fruit except Grapes (5) Dried Fruit is an Artisan Good made from the Dehydrator, taking one in-game day. The amount of energy and health restored from dried fruit is 3 times the base fruit Energy/Health restoration. The sell price of Dried Fruit depends on the fruit used (7.5 x Base Fruit Price + 25). Since the Dehydrator requires 5 fruit per use, the net advantage of drying fruit is (1.5x Fruit Base Price + 5) per fruit used. With the Artisan profession, the benefit is (2.1x Fruit Base Price + 7) per fruit used. Since value is based on Fruit Base Price alone, similarly to Sashimi, the actual benefit compared to selling the fruit will decrease for fruit of higher quality, along with a slight decrease in actual benefit if the Fruit benefits from the Tiller profession. For example, if Artisan profession is not chosen iridium quality Fruit will generally make a loss if dehydrated and gold quality only make a 5g profit per fruit if the Tiller profession does not apply.

It is the only fish that can spawn in lava. In the Mines, the chances of hooking a Lava Eel depends on fishing level and equipment of the farmer, as well as the fishing zone of the fished tile. The base chance of hooking a Lava Eel is 1.8%, which is increased by 0.32% per Fishing Level and 0.08% per fishing zone. This is increased by a further 4% if a Curiosity Lure is equipped, and by 8% if Lava Eel Bait is equipped.[1] For example, with a Fishing Level of 10 and in fishing zone 5, the chance of hooking a Lava Eel is 5.4%. This increases to 9.4% with a Curiosity Lure equipped, to 13.4% with Lava Eel Bait equipped, and to 17.4% with both a Curiosity Lure and Lava Eel Bait equipped. At the Volcano Caldera, a Lava Eel can only be hooked at Fishing level 7 or higher. Assuming that the 'Physics 101' painting has already been caught, there is a 10% chance to potentially hook a Lava Eel, multiplied by the fishing zone of the fished tile, for a maximum of 50% in fishing zone 5. If this first chance succeeds, there is then a 5% base chance to successfully hook the fish, increased by 2% per Fishing Level, and reduced by 0.5% if in fishing zone 1. If Lava Eel Bait is equipped, both chances are multiplied by 1.66, and if the first attempt to hook a Lava Eel fails, a second attempt will be made to hook it.[2] Assuming that the 'Physics 101' painting has already been caught, with a Fishing Level of 10 and in fishing zone 5, the overall chance of hooking a Lava Eel is 12.5%. This increases to 57% with Lava Eel Bait equipped, and further increases to a maximum of 83.4% if the farmer uses buffs to increase their Fishing Level to the maximum of 19.[3][4] A Curiosity Lure has no effect if the farmer has a Fishing Level of 10 or higher.[5] Of the non-legendary fish, it is the fish with the highest sell price and the second highest difficulty fish (after Octopus, tied with the Scorpion Carp).

Information Source Fish Pond  Fishing Treasure Chests Season All Energy / Health 50 22 Sell Price 30 + (Base Fish Price / 2) Roe are fish eggs that are produced by fish in a Fish Pond. They can also be found in Fishing Treasure Chests after obtaining the power from the Jewels Of The Sea book (25% chance).[1] The selling price of Roe depends on the fish's base sell price. The equation is 30 + (base fish sell price / 2), rounded down to the next nearest integer. The health and energy gained from eating roe are the same for all types of roe. All types of roe can be placed in a Preserves Jar to create a higher-value Artisan Good: Sturgeon Roe creates Caviar; other roe create fish-specific varieties of Aged Roe. Roe does not belong to any category and therefore it does not benefit from any Profession. It also cannot be sold to Pierre's General Store, but it can be sold to the Fish Shop or placed in the Shipping Bin. At the Stardew Valley Fair, Roe is considered uncategorised (trash), and gives 2-3 points for judging. Contents 1 Roe Types 2 Gifting 3 Artisan Goods 4 Tailoring 5 Bundles 6 Bugs 7 References 8

This could be taken to mean that the people of Pelican Town worship the Earth. In game, it is referred to as "the sign of the vessel". Adventurer's Bundle The shield in the picture has the sign of Yoba on it. Altar of Yoba Found on top of the "Altar of Yoba" (Pierre's Shop). It was originally intended to charge a wand that would allow unlimited teleportation back to the farm.[1] This wand was later implemented as the Return Scepter. Backwoods Grave Abigail's 14-Heart Event results in a monster's grave in the Backwoods, marked with the symbol of Yoba. Grandpa's wall Appears during the starting cutscene. Grave Stone The Grave Stone decoration can be purchased and used to decorate the farm. It can also be seen at the Spirit's Eve festival, at the maze entrance and on the playground.

The tombstones appear as obstacles throughout the third stage. Mayor Lewis' Bedroom Found above his bed. Ring of Yoba The Ring of Yoba has a chance to make you invulnerable after getting hit. Sign of the Vessel The Sign Of The Vessel decoration can be purchased and used to decorate the farm. It also plays a central role in Pam's 9-Heart cutscene. Yoba Shirt The Yoba Shirt can be tailored with Cloth and Solar Essence. Dwarf Plaque Appears on the plaque above the Forge on Ginger Island. Related dialogue Caroline On Sunday mornings, Caroline says: "It was the previous owners who built the altar room. We aren't religious, but we let the other townsfolk use it if they want." Demetrius During Maru's 10-heart event, Demetrius exclaims "Sweet Yoba... it talks!" Emily On Summer 2 when married, Emily may say "May Yoba bless you on this lovely day." If you take Emily to see a movie she dislikes at the Movie Theater, Emily will hold up the symbol of Yoba and say "Yoba, please protect me from the dark energy of this movie." George While George is visiting Yoba's Altar each Sunday morning, he says: "I've never been religious, but hey... I'm old." Jodi On Mondays in year 1, Jodi may say "Yesterday I visited Yoba's Altar to ask for my husband's safe return. I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard sometimes." Jodi visits Yoba's altar each Sunday morning. She has no special dialogue related to Yoba while she's visiting the altar. Kent attends services with her after Year 1. Krobus On Saturdays Krobus may say "On Fridays I stay silent as a sign of devotion to Yoba." Robin On Sundays, Robin may say "My husband almost set the house on fire last night with his science experiment. One of his beakers exploded and sent a fireball into the rafters! Thank Yoba I used fire-resistant lacquer when I built the place." Sandy There is an unimplemented popup dialog in the game that would have triggered if the player attempted to use a teleport wand before charging it: "Nothing happens. Sandy said something about 'infusing it with the power of Yoba'." [2] This wand was later implemented as the Return Scepter, which doesn't require charging. Shane In Shane's six heart event, if the player chooses to respond with "It would be a sin.", Shane says "Yoba...? (Player), don't you know I'm an atheist? Ugh..." After marriage, Shane may say "The name 'Shane' means 'Gift from Yoba'... What a joke." Clara's Letter On the nightstand in George and Evelyn's bedroom there is a letter from their daughter Clara. Among other things, it says "Don't be too upset, I'm with Yoba now." Highlights From The Book of Yoba In the Museum's Library there is a book entitled "Highlights from the Book of Yoba". Before time there was only the endless golden light. The light called out to itself...'Yoba'. Yoba wanted more. Yoba swirled the golden light into a vortex. Yoba swirled and swirled until a hole formed in the eye of the vortex. From this hole sprung a seed. Yoba smoothed the golden light. Yoba smoothed and smoothed, and the light became soil. Into this soil, Yoba planted the seed. The seed sprouted, and behold! A vine sprung skyward, twisting and probing, casting a writhing shadow onto the golden void. After 11 days, the vine bore fruit. Yoba, with knowing wisdom, peeled the tough skin off the fruit and saw that the world was inside. And so that is how the world came to be. References ?

Silo From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Silo Allows you to cut and store grass for feed. Information Build cost: data-sort-value="100">100g Build materials: Stone (100) Clay (10) Copper Bar (5) Size: 3x3 The Silo is a type of farm building purchasable from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop. It takes two days to build. When complete, it stores hay from grass cut on the farm. Behavior Each silo can store up to 240 hay. The current amount stored can be checked by interacting with it. If the player owns multiple silos, it shows the combined total storage and capacity of all silos on The Farm. Hay stored in the silo is accessible through the hay hoppers located inside Coops and Barns to be used for feeding their respective animals. The distance between the silo and the animal buildings does not affect the operation of the hay hoppers. Hay can be added to the silo in a number of ways: When the Player cuts grass on their farm with the scythe, there is a 50% chance that 1 hay is added to the silo (75% if cut with the Golden Scythe). Cutting weeds with melee weapons enchanted with "Haymaker" also has a 33% chance of dropping a hay (directly into silo, else into inventory). When the Player has hay in their inventory, hay can be added to the silo by left- or right-clicking on the silo while holding the hay. Hay can also be added to the silo by clicking the hay hoppers while holding the hay. Tips The silo is a good choice as a first building to be purchased. It takes fewer resources to build than other buildings, and allows a good stock of hay to be gathered before actually having to meet the needs of any animals. Instead of buying multiple silos, hay can be stored in a chest (when received as a gift in the mail from Marnie or withdrawn from the Hay Hopper before a Coop or Barn is fully upgraded). Hay can be moved from the chest to the Silo when necessary. The current amount of hay stored can also be checked at the Farm Computer. Since grass stops growing and provides less hay on average in Winter, and farm animals will entirely rely on hay for the whole season, it's advisable to cut as much grass as needed to fill the silo(s) near the end of fall, even if it takes all the grass left on the farm. To avoid purchasing hay in the winter, you will need 26 hay stored per animal (animals consume no food during the Festival of Ice or Feast of the Winter Star). 1 silo can feed 9 animals, so a total of 3 silos would be needed to feed the 24 animals of a full Deluxe Barn and Deluxe Coop for the season. Hay can also be obtained when harvesting Wheat. However, hay obtained this way does not automatically go into the silo, but into the player's inventory.

As well as selling those items, Pierre also buys foraged items, crops and crop seeds, artisan goods, cooked dishes, and animal products from the player. This avoids waiting overnight for shipping, but does not count as shipping for the purpose of achievements or collections.

Preserves Jar Productivity From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search No Profession Tiller Artisan This page lists the productivity of processing Fruits, Vegetables, and Ginger into Jellies and Pickles and Roe into Aged Roe or Caviar in a Preserves Jar. The products produced always sell for more than the raw input items (except in the case of gold or iridium Blackberries after learning the Bear's Knowledge), so using a Preserves Jar is almost always profitable. Jellies and Pickles are always regular quality, so the profit made from processing items is lowest when using iridium quality and highest when using regular quality items. This table does not take into account the effects of Tiller or Artisan professions, which reduce and increase the profit from a Preserves Jar, respectively. To view the profitability for those professions, use the links at the top of the page. Note that the processing time for a Preserves Jar is always 4000 minutes, with one exception: Sturgeon Roe produces Caviar in 6000 minutes rather than 4000. Productivity (g/minute) = ([Processed Sell Price] - [Input Item Sell Price]) / [Processing time] Approximate g/day = Productivity (g/minute) * 1600 [1] Note that you may click on a column header to sort the table by that column, then Shift+Click on a second column to perform a secondary sort.

Ostrich Incubator From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Ostrich Incubator Hatches ostrich eggs into baby ostriches. Place in a barn. Information Source Crafting Sell Price Cannot be sold Crafting Recipe Source Professor Snail Ingredients Bone Fragment (50) Hardwood (50) Cinder Shard (20) The Ostrich Incubator is a piece of Refining Equipment used to hatch Ostrich Eggs into Ostriches. The recipe for the incubator is given by Professor Snail after completing the fossil collection and surveys at the Island Field Office. The incubator must be placed in a barn, but more than one can be placed in the same barn. It takes 15,000m (9d 10h) to incubate an egg.[1] This time can be cut in half to 7,500m (4d 18h 20m) with the Coopmaster Profession. To begin incubation, right click the machine while holding an ostrich egg. If multiple Ostrich Eggs are ready to be hatched, only one will be hatched when entering the barn. Leaving and re-entering will allow for further eggs to be hatched. If the barn is at capacity (4 animals for a Barn, 8 for a Big Barn, 12 for a Deluxe Barn), the ostrich won't hatch until a space is freed-up. This can happen by selling an animal or moving an animal to another barn. Once the barn is below capacity, entering will cause the egg to hatch instantly. References ? See Object::performObjectDropInAction in the game code. Notes If the incubator is broken while holding an Ostrich Egg, both the egg and incubator will drop.

Ice Rod From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. Ice Rod Shoots an orb of ice every X seconds, freezing any enemies in its path for Y seconds. Information Source: Monsters  Crates and Barrels  Skull Cavern Treasure Rooms Adventurer's Guild Purchase Price: N/A Sell Price: data-sort-value="1000">1,000g The Ice Rod is a trinket item that can be obtained by slaying monsters or breaking crates and barrels in the Mines, Skull Cavern, or Quarry Mine. Drop chances from both methods are affected by daily luck and luck buffs, among other factors. The Burglar's Ring and Monster Compendium do not impact the chance to obtain it from monsters.[1] There is also a ~0.6% chance to obtain an Ice Rod from a treasure chest in the Skull Cavern.[2] While the Ice Rod is equipped in the trinket slot, the player occasionally shoots an ice orb that briefly freezes all monsters in its path. When enemies are within 9-10 tiles of the player, an ice orb is automatically shot straight towards the nearest enemy. Ice orbs do not cause damage and pass through all environmental objects (like mining nodes or weeds).[3] The time between shots (X) ranges from 3 to 5 seconds, and the freeze duration (Y) ranges from 2 to 4 seconds. These times are determined to the millisecond, and all possible values are equally likely when the Ice Rod is dropped. The trinket description will round these values to the nearest tenth of a second (i.e., a freeze duration of 2.367 seconds will be displayed as 2.4 seconds).[4] Both stats can be changed if the trinket is re-forged on an Anvil. When dropped or re-forged, the Ice Rod has a 5% chance to become "Perfect" and change its name to the "Perfect Ice Rod". This variant fires every 3 seconds and freezes for 4 seconds.[4] Contents 1 Gifting 2 Trivia 3 References 4

Weapons are quite unlike other tools, as firstly they do not cost energy to use, and secondly they are not upgraded at the Blacksmith. Instead, most weapons can be found as monster drops, purchased from the Adventurer's Guild, or found in chests in the Mines. Most weapons (except the slingshots) can also be sold to the Adventurer's Guild. Most weapons have a secondary (special) attack, executed by right-clicking. With the sword, you will block some damage or knock back flying enemies. A club will smash the ground, knocking back nearby enemies and causing minor damage. With a dagger, you will perform a series of quick stabs. While not designed for combat, the Axe, Pickaxe, and Scythe can be used as weapons to inflict a small amount of damage. The Axe and Pickaxe consume energy, while the Scythe does not.

Once you have unlocked an animal by building the coop needed to house it, that animal can be placed in any other non-upgraded coops you have built as well. The Deluxe Coop features an Autofeed System; hay from your silos will be automatically distributed. (You can still let the animals feed on grass outside, and the hay will not be eaten.) Coop Animals may be stuck outside at night if the coop doors are closed. The conditions for this are not clear (see Animals trapped outside). If an animal is stuck outside the coop at night, the next day their mood will be "grumpy". Animals stuck outside are also subject to Wild Animal Attacks. The Coop can also be used in a manner similar to the Shed for storing Chests, Artisan Equipment, Furniture, etc. The animals are undisturbed by the clutter, even if their paths are blocked.

It cannot be placed on floors 0 or 120 of the mines or in the Quarry Mine. Staircases work just like the game-supplied down-ladders. Each one works only for one use. Leaving the mine or returning to a higher floor will result in the staircase being permanently gone. In addition, once a staircase has been placed, it cannot be picked up again, even if it has not been used. Stone can be purchased from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop if the player does not have enough.

Dance of the Moonlight Jellies From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search The Dance of the Moonlight Jellies is a Festival that takes place at night on the 28th of every Summer at The Beach. The player can choose to attend the festival by entering the area between 10 pm and 12 am. When the festival ends, they will be returned to The Farm at midnight. On the festival day, the player cannot enter the beach before 10 pm. Using a Warp Totem: Beach or Water Obelisk before 10 pm will result in a popup box saying "Today's festival is being set up.

During the festival, villagers gather at the docks to watch migrating jellyfish attracted to the lights set up. Pierre will set up a stall in the northwest corner of the beach to sell items. Even if the wooden bridge to the east hasn't been repaired this will not affect the festival scene, where it will be temporarily repaired allowing the player to speak to the characters in that area (namely Robin and family, Leah, and the Wizard in the dark northeastern corner).

Information Source Crafting Sell Price data-sort-value="30">30g Recipe Recipe Source(s) Island Trader for Cinder Shard (50) Ingredients Stone (5) Fiber (3) Clay (1) Deluxe Retaining Soil is a Fertilizer that keeps soil watered. It can be crafted after purchasing the recipe from the Island Trader for 50 Cinder Shards. 5-7 Deluxe Retaining Soil may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least two times. Deluxe Retaining Soil can be placed on tilled soil before or after planting a seed, or at any stage of crop growth. If the soil is not already watered, the fertilizer has no water to retain and plants will not grow until watered once. The chance for retaining water is 100%, which means after watering once the soil will be guaranteed to be watered up until the crop is ready to be harvested. This makes it especially useful in situations where Sprinklers are unavailable, such as in Garden Pots or in most areas on the Beach Farm. If a crop that yields multiple produce from one planting is fertilized with Deluxe Retaining Soil, water retention continues through all repeating harvests. In the Greenhouse, on the Ginger Island Farm, or in Garden Pots in buildings, where seasonal changes do not affect a planting's lifetime, the fertilizer remains until the tile is un-tilled.

Egg Festival From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search The Egg Festival is the first festival of the year, taking place on the 13th of every Spring in Pelican Town Square. Like other festivals, the event lasts for most of the day and consists of two parts: a social portion and an Egg Hunt activity to finish the day. To take part, enter Pelican Town Square between 9am and 2pm. (It is impossible to enter the town before 9am; attempting to enter will say that the event is still being set up.) The festival will end immediately after the Egg Hunt or if the player leaves the Town, returning them to The Farm at 10pm. Firstly, the villagers will be gathered in the town square and the player can socialize with them. There is also a booth set up where the player can purchase decorative items and Strawberry Seeds. Planting the seeds by the 16th allows Strawberries to be harvested twice before Summer. Talking to Mayor Lewis will proceed to the second portion of the event, which in turn leads to the end of the day; it will not be possible to talk to anyone or buy items afterwards, so finish everything first. Secondly, the featured attraction of the festival is the Egg Hunt. The player and some other villagers will have 50 seconds to search for small colored eggs hidden around Pelican Town. The amount of eggs required to win is dependent on the number of players currently in the game. In a solo game (or with only 1 player online in a multiplayer game), the player must gather 9 colored eggs, or else Abigail will win. With 2 players, 6 eggs are required to win, 5 eggs with 3 players, or 4 eggs with 4 or more players.[1] If the player wins, they will receive a Straw Hat as a reward. If the player has already won an Egg Hunt in previous years, they will receive a Prize Ticket. In a Multiplayer game, if two or more players find enough eggs to win, then only the player with the highest number of eggs gets the prize. If 2 or more players tie, then all winning players get the prize. Starting from Year 2, the layout of the festival and the placement of eggs is changed.

Backwoods From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Locations in the Backwoods where forageable items can spawn. The Backwoods is an exterior region in the northwest part of Stardew Valley. It consists of two disconnected sections. The higher elevation section is a path connecting the Farm to the Mountain in an L-shaped curve. The lower section (outlined in blue in the map) can only be reached by heading west along the road from the Bus Stop, and provides access to The Tunnel. Contents 1 Foraging 2 Artifact Spots 3 Villager Paths 4 Quests 5 References Foraging Forageable items found on the ground in the Backwoods are:[1] In Spring: Leek (58%), and Wild Horseradish (42%) In Summer: Grape (62%), and Spice Berry (38%) In Fall: Hazelnut (53%), Common Mushroom (24%), and Wild Plum (24%) In Winter: Holly (43%), Crocus (35%), and Crystal Fruit (22%) Forageable items spawn at an average rate of 0.4 per night in spring, summer, and fall; in winter the rate is 0.25 per night.[2] They spawn only in the higher-elevation section of the Backwoods. The map shows the possible locations as red and magenta tiles; when the original trees are present, the magenta tiles have a 90% smaller chance of spawning items because they are identified as being behind the original trees. There are also numerous Salmonberry and Blackberry bushes in both sections of the Backwoods. Artifact Spots The only Artifact that can be found by digging up Artifact Spots in the Backwoods is: Skeletal Hand (4-8%[3]) Other possible items are: 1-3 Clay (18-39%[3]) Lost Book (20% + 5-9%[3]); once all Lost Books have been found, any potential Lost Book is replaced by Mixed Seeds. Only in Winter: Winter Root (24%) Only in Winter: Snow Yam (16%) 1-3 Stone (6-13%[3]) 1-3 Copper Ore (3-7%[3]) Only in Spring: 2-5 Rice Shoots (5%) 1-3 Coal (2.4-5%[3]) An unseen Secret Note: up to 3% chance, only if the player has a Magnifying Glass. Artifact spots spawn only in the higher-elevation section of the Backwoods, at an average rate of 0.06 per night, except in winter when the average rate increases to 0.4 per night.[4] Villager Paths No villagers walk through the Backwoods, so items can be safely placed in any location. Quests Linus' Blackberry Basket After receiving Linus' letter and accepting the blackberry basket quest, the basket is located in the lower section of the Backwoods at the left side of the screen. Although it can be seen from the upper path, the basket can only be reached by exiting the Bus Stop to the west along the road. The Backwoods is the scene of Abigail's 14-heart event. References ?

Maple Tree From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Maple Tree Information Seed Maple Seed Tapper Product Maple Syrup Growth Time Variable A Maple Tree is a common Tree that grows from a Maple Seed. It yields Maple Syrup every 9 days when tapped. It can be chopped down with an axe, producing Wood, Sap, possible Maple Seeds, and possible Hardwood (if the player is a Lumberjack). Normally, shaking a Maple Tree has a chance of producing a Maple Seed, but during the last two weeks of Fall (includes Fall 14), a Hazelnut is dropped instead. A planted Maple Seed grows through four stages before reaching maturity (with twice as much time spent at stage 4). If fertilized, this takes five days (even in Winter). Otherwise, there is a 20% chance per day of growth, except in winter when trees do not grow. The median time to maturity is 24 days, although individual tree growth times will vary considerably. Chopping a stage 23 tree with an axe has a chance to drop one wood, depending on foraging level. This doesn't happen when cutting it with other tools. Maple Trees outside the farm (except in Pelican Town) can be chopped down or tapped. These trees will respawn as Stage 3 saplings (20% chance each day) and grow as normal after that, as long as the stump is removed, and there is nothing on the tree's tile. Stages of Growth Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4 Stage 5 - Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter Stump - Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter

Winter Seeds are one of the season-specific crafted wild seeds, along with Spring Seeds, Summer Seeds, and Fall Seeds that produce crops normally found as forage. While Farming Skill normally increases the chance to grow a quality crop, Foraging Skill increases the chance to grow a quality crop from Winter Seeds. Choosing the Botanist profession will ensure iridium-quality crops grown from Winter Seeds. Crows do not attack crops grown from Winter Seeds, so the use of Scarecrows is unnecessary. There is a 50% chance to obtain 10 Winter Seeds as a silver tier reward on the 12th for the SquidFest festival and a 50% chance to obtain 15 Winter Seeds as a silver tier reward on the 13th for the SquidFest festival.

Coffee Beans grow and mature 10 days after being planted (and every 2 days thereafter) in either Spring or Summer. The primary source of Coffee Beans is Dust Sprites, but they are only rarely dropped (1% chance). They may also randomly appear in the Traveling Cart's Special Stock for data-sort-value="2500">2,500g (25% chance in Fall/Winter) or Standard Stock for data-sort-value="15"1001,000g (during all seasons). Coffee Beans cannot be purchased from any other stores. When harvested, each plant gives four beans every two days, with a 2% chance for more beans. Basic Fertilizer and Quality Fertilizer affect only the first bean from every harvest. Because Coffee Bean is fundamentally considered to be a seed (rather than a vegetable or fruit), its sale price does not benefit from the Tiller profession. Also, it cannot be placed into a Preserves Jar. However, 5 Coffee Beans can be placed inside a Keg to produce Coffee.

Slingshot From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Slingshot Requires stones for ammo. Information Type: Slingshot Source: Chest at Floor 40 of The Mines Damage: Depends on ammo used Critical Strike Chance: .02 Adventurer's Guild Purchase Price: data-sort-value="500 ">500g Sell Price: Cannot be sold The Slingshot is a slingshot weapon that can be obtained from the chest on floor 40 of The Mines. After that, it can be purchased at the Adventurer's Guild for data-sort-value="500">500g. Despite its description, many items other than Stone can be used as Slingshot ammunition. Unlike most weapons, using a slingshot on a villager will decrease friendship with them by 30 points. Using a slingshot on the cat or dog will produce a "hate" dialogue bubble, but will not decrease friendship. Ammunition To equip a slingshot with ammunition, select the ammunition, then Right-Click on the slingshot. The type of ammunition used determines the damage dealt, according to the following formulas: Slingshot: Damage = AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1] Master Slingshot: Damage = 2 * (AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1]) With the worst ammo (i.e., Fruits, Vegetables, or Eggs), a Slingshot can deal 1-3 and a Master Slingshot can deal 2-6 damage. With the best ammo, Iridium Ore and a Slingshot can deal 25-101 damage while a Master Slingshot can deal 50-202 damage. The following items can be used as ammunition: Item AmmoMultiplier Slingshot Damage Master Slingshot Damage All Fruits  All Vegetables  All Eggs 1 1-3 2-6 Coal 15 8-31 16-62 Copper Ore 10 5-21 10-42 Explosive Ammo 20 10-41 20-82 Gold Ore 30 15-61 30-122 Iridium Ore 50 25-101 50-202 Iron Ore 20 10-41 20-82 Stone 5 3-11 6-22 Wood 2 1-5 2-10 Notes The clipping glitch that allows the player to enter the normally unreachable space around a map area does not work with slingshots. Using a Warp Totem and switching the held item to a slingshot will break the player's character model. The player will be allowed to move around freely for a short time before the warp totem takes effect and teleports the player away. If the slingshot is pulled back before the player teleports, the teleport is canceled. The player's character model and its directional position will be locked in place; however, movement is still enabled in this state. Any interactions with objects or villagers reverses the character's model to it's default state.

It can also be foraged from a narrow strip of shore by the Tide Pools, i.e., to the east of the wooden footbridge[1], but it spawns relatively infrequently (3% chance per night). The saltwater crab pot fish (Cockle, Crab, Lobster, Mussel, Oyster, and Shrimp) may produce 1-3 Seaweed in a Fish Pond when the population of the pond is at least 1. It's also possible to find Seaweed in the "Dangerous Mines" on floors 1-29 when the Shrine of Challenge is turned on. This seaweed will always be normal quality.

Seaweed is displayed in the Fish section of the collection tab, and counts towards the four fishing Achievements.[2] However, it is otherwise not considered to be a fish, and therefore cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop, does not benefit from fish price bonuses, and cannot be used in fish recipes.

Health From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Getting Started The Player Options Controls Mobile Controls Health Energy Skills Day Cycle A slightly drained Health Bar (Left) Health is measured by a bar next to the energy bar in the bottom right corner of the user interface (UI). The health bar is only visible while inside of The Mines, the Secret Woods, the Slime Hutch, the Skull Cavern, the Mutant Bug Lair, the Quarry Mine, the Volcano Dungeon, or when the meter is not full. The most common way to lose health is by being attacked by Monsters, such as those in the Mines or the Slimes in the Secret Woods or Slime Hutch, though players can also lose health by getting hit by the train on the Railroad. Players may choose the Wilderness Map, or offer a Strange Bun to the Dark Shrine of Night Terrors in the Witch's Hut to enable Monsters on The Farm, who will attack and drain the player's health at night. Health can be replenished either by consuming food, sleeping, or using the Spa. In a multiplayer game, health (and energy) can be replenished by standing in bed without going to sleep for the day. Maximum health capacity starts at 100 points. Each increase in Combat Level adds 5 points to the player's health meter, with the exceptions of levels 5 and 10. Health points are only increased when levelling up to levels 5 or 10 if the Fighter and Defender professions are chosen. Finding Secret Note #10 and then meeting Mr. Qi at floor 100 of the Skull Cavern will award the player with a cutscene in which Mr. Qi gives the player "Iridium snake milk", which will increase maximum health by 25 points. The player will pass out when health reaches zero. The only exception is if the player has a Phoenix Ring and is using the ring's ability for the first time on that day. One of the villagers will awaken the player. Depending on which one it is, the player may wake up in the entry room of The Mines, in the bedroom of the Farmhouse, or in Harvey's Clinic. If the player passes out inside the Skull Cavern, they will be awakened inside Harvey's Clinic. While passed out, the player will lose gold and may lose up to three inventory items. One lost item can be retrieved through the "Item Recovery Service" at the Adventurer's Guild. The amount of gold lost is determined by the player's currently available gold, up to data-sort-value="15000">15,000g. Notes Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. If the player has a Vampire Ring equipped, they will gain 2 health points after slaying a monster.

A bouquet can be purchased at Pierre's General Store for data-sort-value="200">200g any time after reaching an 8-heart friendship with a marriage candidate. Giving a bouquet to a marriage candidate indicates romantic interest and changes the recipient's status to "boyfriend" or "girlfriend" on the "Social" tab of the pause menu. You may give a bouquet to any or all qualified candidates, but only once to each. Giving a bouquet awards 25 friendship points, but does not count as a normal gift. It unfreezes the friendship level with each recipient, allowing it to increase to 10 hearts, and to decay. Note that pre-bouquet, friendship points with a marriage candidate can continue to increase to just below 9 hearts (2249 points). Trying to give a bouquet to someone that is not listed as single will simply say that you cannot date that person. Persisting in attempting to give a bouquet to a non-marriage candidate may produce additional dialogue, such as "I don't get it" or "Is this a joke?" Giving a bouquet to a marriage candidate when you have less than four hearts of friendship with them causes them to respond "...I don't really know you well enough..." or "Uh... This is awkward. Look, I don't really know you that well...". If you have between 4 and 8 hearts of friendship, the marriage candidate will respond "Oh? ...Sorry... I'm not ready for that." or "...I didn't know. Uh... Sorry. No.". The bouquet can be sold for data-sort-value="100">100g via the shipping box. Pierre will not buy them back. A bouquet can be used to create a Wilted Bouquet, which is used to break up with a girlfriend or boyfriend. The Wilted Bouquet is created by placing a bouquet in a furnace along with one coal.

Green Rain Trees From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. Green Rain Trees comprise three varieties of trees that can appear during the Green Rain weather event. On the day of the Green Rain weather event, approximately 75% of trees have a chance to turn into one of the varieties of Green Rain Trees. These trees revert back to their original form on the next day. All three types of Green Rain Trees can spawn naturally during the Green Rain event, can grow from Mossy Seeds, or can have a fully-grown Common Tree grow into one. Planted Mossy Seeds have about a 20% chance per day of growth, except in Winter when trees do not grow. If the seeds are fertilized, then Green Rain trees will grow in five days (even in Winter).[1] Each of the three Green Rain Tree varieties may spread seeds like a common tree, including the temporary trees that exist only for one day during the green rain. When a fully grown Green Rain Tree with moss on it is placed next to a Common Tree, it speeds up the time it takes for a common tree to grow or regrow its moss, provided the tree has reached at least 5th stage. The exact math is 50% chance to have an additional growth stage gain at the start of the day. This growth can only impact fully grown trees, so its only impact is on the moss growth. See Moss Growth.

This effect is applied after any Weapon Speed buff effects.[1] Because the effect is a percent multiplier, it works differently than the Weapon Speed buff. A sword or dagger with +0 Weapon Speed would effectively have +1 Weapon Speed while wearing the ring (40 milliseconds faster), whereas a club with +0 Weapon Speed would be closer to +2 with the ring (72 milliseconds faster).

Festival of Ice From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search The Festival of Ice takes place on the 8th of every Winter. The player attends the festival by entering Cindersap Forest between 9am and 2pm. When the festival ends, the player will be returned to The Farm at 10pm. The festival features ice sculptures, snowmen, and igloos. There's also an Ice Fishing Contest the player can take part in along with Pam, Willy, and Elliott. The player must catch at least five fish to win the competition, or else Willy will win. The first time the player wins, their prize is two tackles (a Barbed Hook and a Dressed Spinner), a Magnet, and a Sailor's Cap. Thereafter, winning awards a Prize Ticket. If two or more players in a Multiplayer game win the Ice Fishing Contest, all winning players receive the reward(s). The holes in the ice are quite small, so it can be difficult to cast into them. Standing close to the hole and casting a minimal distance is the easiest way to do this. It is possible to catch fish outside of the frozen lake, in the forest pond and the forest river. Fish caught in the forest pond count towards the fishing competition, but those caught in the river do not. The festival ends automatically after Mayor Lewis judges the fishing contest.

Grub From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Grub Information Spawns In: The Mines Floors: 15-29 Killable: Yes Base HP: 20 Base Damage: 4 Base Def: 0 Speed: 1 XP: 2 Variations: Mutant Grub Grub (dangerous) Drops: Ancient Seed (0.5%) Bug Meat (60%) Dwarf Scroll I (0.5%) Dwarf Scroll IV (0.1%) White Algae (2%) Rice Shoot (10% (5%+5%)) Bait And Bobber (??%) If reached bottom of Mines: Diamond (0.05%) Prismatic Shard (0.05%) Grubs are an enemy found in the Mines. Grubs count towards the 80 Cave Insects killed for Monster Eradication Goals. Behavior Pupating Grub Grubs appear in groups and attack on sight. Upon sustaining critical damage, they will flee and attempt to pupate. When pupating, a Grub turns blue-green and is immune to all damage. It will emerge from its blue-green cocoon as a Cave Fly. Strategy Attempt to separate them from their groups to avoid being overrun. If you find a single grub, simply attack it constantly and chase it down if it tries to escape. They do not charge you like slimes do, making it impossible for them to hit you if you have a weapon with decent knockback. If you encounter a group of grubs, use a weapon with medium or high knockback to push them all against a wall or into a corner, that way none of them can escape. Just make sure to not let any escape from the corner, as fighting a flying insect and a group of grubs is quite dangerous, especially if there are a lot of grubs. Explosive ammo from your slingshot also works well.

Night Market From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search The Night Market is a festival that occurs between the 15th and 17th of Winter. Various boats and merchants will appear at the docks on the Beach, and offer to sell goods or take the player for a boat ride. The Night Market is open between 5pm and 2am, but the Submarine Ride closes at 11pm, and the Mermaid Boat closes at 12:30am. Unlike other festivals, shops and homes throughout Stardew Valley (including those at the beach) are not closed on the days of the event, and time continues to pass during the festival. Animals also need to be fed during the event; the game will not automatically consider them to be fed.

Despite being only one block wide, it is still possible to ride a horse through any orientation of gate in any direction. Breaking the gate with a pickaxe does not destroy it, so you can break it and immediately replace it the day before it degrades. A gate can replace a placed fence piece (by selecting the gate in inventory and clicking on the fence piece). You can make hardwood and stone gates this way. If surrounded by other fence pieces, the gate may take on the color of the fence instead of the normal dark brown color.

Mobile Saves From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search For save file locations, methods of saving on PC and consoles, and save file editing documentation see Saves. To find mobile saves, see android saves or iOS saves. On mobile, Stardew Valley's save method is based upon the system used for computers, but with some additions to make it more suited to mobile devices. The game creates a folder on the device for each saved game. In that folder, there are three different kinds of save files which can appear - Standard Saves, Emergency Saves and Backup saves. Contents 1 Standard Saves 2 Emergency Saves 3 Backup Saves 4 Bugs Standard Saves Standard Saves are the same format found on the PC version of the game. The PC version only allows saving when going to sleep, so standard saves retain this system. A standard save always starts at 6am in the morning when loaded. These saves are compatible with PC, and can be transferred back and forth. When a standard save happens, the mobile version (like PC) keeps your previous standard save, using the suffix _old. Occasionally, save files might encounter problems. If this happens, players can swap between the most recent standard save and the previous backup by pressing the Swap to previous save button on the Options page. Emergency Saves Unlike a PC, a mobile device can sometimes interrupt the game - for example, if a phone call happens mid-game. Also, players may change to another app, and want to resume where they left off in the game later on. When the app is no longer shown on the screen, it is classed as being a background app. If the phone or tablet is running low on resources, it might automatically unload any background apps, losing any unsaved progress. If the game moves into the background, and then resumed, if the app hasnt been unloaded by the phone/tablet, it will continue where it left off. If the game has been unloaded, however, the game will be reloaded, and will then need to load a save in order to carry on where it left off. To allow this, the game does an emergency save when it goes into the background (for example, when you press the home button on an iPhone). Because of the complexity of Stardew Valley, this save takes a few seconds. If you kill the app before this save is completed (by swiping it away from the list of background apps), the game will not complete its emergency save. Note: If the game time is less than 6:20am, no emergency saves are created because the standard 6am save is assumed to be sufficient. When the game loads up, it checks to see if theres a file called EMERGENCY_SAVE present. If there is, it looks in that file to find the location of the most recent emergency save. If it finds one, the player is asked "Would you like to restore from where you previously left off?" when the main menu loads, allowing the player to load the emergency save. The game does not delete emergency saves once they've been loaded. Instead, the emergency saves will be deleted only when the game saves either a standard or backup save. Only one emergency save exists per device (i.e., the emergency save is not associated with a specific game ID / character). Backup Saves At any time (other than during certain festivals, cutscenes and other events), players can manually save the game with the Save Backup button on the options page. This saves progress as a backup file, using the same format as an emergency save, except associated with a specific game ID. The game time in a backup save is always the start of the next ten-minute interval. When selecting a game to load, if a backup file exists the player is asked "Would you like to restore from where you previously left off?". Selecting "Yes" causes the backup file to be loaded; selecting "No" loads the standard 6am save. Only one backup save can exist per game ID; a new backup save overwrites any previous backup for that game ID. Backup saves are automatically deleted when a new standard save is created for the game ID (i.e., overnight, after any level up dialogs and shipping reports). They are not deleted, however, when an emergency save is created. In order to maintain compatibility with the PC version, the game needs to keep the standard save to be the 6am morning save. But, the PC version isnt compatible with the concept of loading/saving anywhere/any time, so that's why these multiple systems are supported. Bugs Some game details are not stored in Backup Saves or Emergency Saves, leading to slight differences in game play after reloading from one of these saves. Known differences include: Any unaccepted quest at the Help Wanted board is lost. Any active Fishing Bubbles or Panning locations are lost. However, ones that were scheduled to start later in the day will still happen. Icons for any active buffs are always lost. Depending on the type of buff, the actual effect of the buff is either lost or buggy: Buffs for Farming, Foraging, Fishing, and Mining remain active. The enhanced skill level remains visible as a green value in the skills menu, and all bonuses (e.g., energy cost of tool usage, fishing casting distance, bonus wild berries) remain in effect. The buff does not expire at the scheduled time, but instead remains active for the rest of the day, until the player sleeps. Multiple skill buffs can be stacked using repeated backup saves, including multiple buffs to the same skill. Increasing skills to unrealistic values can trigger additional bugs (e.g., negative energy costs for tool usage at skill > 20) Speed and Magnetism buffs are lost on reload. Other non-skill buffs may also be lost. All water troughs in Slime Hutches are emptied, preventing Slime Balls from spawning the next day.

Trash From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search This article is about the category of items. For the specific item, see Trash (item). Trash is a category of items in Stardew Valley. With the exception of the Rotten Plant, these items have a chance to be collected when fishing, or obtained from Garbage Cans. All except for Joja Cola and the Rotten Plant can be collected from Crab Pots. Trash is the less favorable alternative when fishing, as fish are worth more to sell and have far more uses. However, trash items (other than Joja Cola and the Rotten Plant) can be used in a Recycling Machine to create more useful materials. A random trash item is caught while fishing, after failing skill checks to get a bite ("hit") from every type of fish and other catchables currently available at a location. More types of fish currently available at a location generally results in a greater chance of a bite, which results in a decreased chance of catching trash. Trash is therefore much more common when fishing in locations with few types of fish and rarer fish, such as The Mines, and trash is the only possible result when fishing in the Farm Pond on a Standard Farm. The likelihood of catching trash at most locations will also decrease substantially as fishing skill increases. At fishing level 10, trash frequency can decrease by over 20 percentage points if few types of fish are present, and trash frequency approaches 0% when at least 5 types of fish (including algae and seaweed) are present.[1] Catching Trash with a fishing pole grants 3 Fishing XP. Harvesting Trash from a Crab Pot grants 5 Fishing XP. In the fishing minigame at the Stardew Valley Fair, trash items are worth one point. The Rotten Plant can be obtained by a Jack-O-Lantern which becomes a Rotten Plant when standing outside in Winter. It can also be found as a part of a secret. During the special order quest Community Cleanup the player is tasked with gathering 20 trash items (except Joja Cola). Types Image Name Description Produce from Recycling Trash It's junk. Stone (1-3) 39% Coal (1-3) 30% Iron Ore (1-3) 21% Driftwood A piece of wood from the sea. Wood (1-3) 75% Coal (1-3) 25% Soggy Newspaper This is trash.

Information Source Tilling  Winter Seeds Season Winter XP Tilling: 0 Winter Seeds: 7 Foraging XP Energy / Health 30 13 42 18 54 24 78 35 Sell Price 100g 125g 150g 200g The Snow Yam is a foraging item found only in Winter. Wild snow yams do not grow above ground, but instead they are buried in the snow/dirt and must be dug up with a Hoe (no other tools, even Bombs, will work). The highest chance of finding a Snow Yam (11-16%, map-dependent) is when digging up an Artifact Spot.[1] There is also a 4% chance of finding a Snow Yam when digging standard tillable soil in any exterior location.[2] Exceptions are in the Farm, where Snow Yams can be found at artifact spots, but not standard tillable soil, and in the Desert, where Snow Yams can not be found at all. Digging up a Snow Yam provides no experience. Snow Yams can also be grown from Winter Seeds, in which case they are a standard wild-seed crop: they grow above ground, can be harvested without using a tool, give 7 Foraging XP each, and are affected by the Gatherer and Botanist professions.

Preserves Jar Productivity - Artisan From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search No Profession Tiller Artisan This page lists the productivity of processing Fruits, Vegetables, and Ginger into Jellies and Pickles and Roe into Aged Roe or Caviar in a Preserves Jar. The products produced always sell for more than the raw input items (except in the case of iridium Blackberries with the Tiller profession, after learning the Bear's Knowledge), so using a Preserves Jar is almost always profitable. Jellies and Pickles are always regular quality, so the profit made from processing items is lowest when using iridium quality and highest when using regular quality items. This table shows the profitability of processing items when the player has chosen the Artisan Profession (note that the Tiller Profession is a prerequisite for the Artisan Profession so both are taken into account here). To view the profitability for no profession, or the Tiller Profession, use the links at the top of the page. Note that the processing time for a Preserves Jar is always 4000 minutes, with one exception: Sturgeon Roe produces Caviar in 6000 minutes rather than 4000. Productivity (g/minute) = ([Processed Sell Price] - [Input Item Sell Price]) / [Processing time] Approximate g/day = Productivity (g/minute) * 1600 [1] Note that you may click on a column header to sort the table by that column, then Shift+Click on a second column to perform a secondary sort.

Cask Productivity From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Article Stub This article is marked as a stub for the following reason: Page needs to follow the format of Keg Productivity and Preserves Jar Productivity This page lists the productivity of processing Wine, Cheese, Goat Cheese, Pale Ale, Mead, and Beer in a Cask. With the exception of the two highest-value wines, cheeses give the best value compared to the processing time required to age them to iridium quality. The best value wines are included in the table below along with all unique cask products. Name Processing Time (Iridium) Value Increase (Reg. to Iridium) Gold/Day Value Increase (Reg. to Iridium) (Artisan Prof.) Gold/Day (Artisan Prof.) Starfruit Wine 56 Days 2250g 40.2 3150g 56.3 Ancient Fruit Wine 56 Days 1650g 29.5 2310g 41.3 Goat Cheese 14 Days 400g 28.6 560g 40.0 Cheese 14 Days 230g 16.4 322g 23.0 Pineapple Wine 56 Days 900g 16.1 1260g 22.5 Melon Wine 56 Days 750g 13.4 1050g 18.8 Rhubarb Wine 56 Days 660g 11.8 924g 16.5 Pale Ale 34 Days 300g 8.8 420g 12.4 Banana or Crystal Fruit Wine 56 Days 450g 8.0 630g 11.3 Peach or Pomegranate Wine 56 Days 420g 7.5 588g 10.5 Beer or Mead 28 Days 200g 7.1 280g 10.0 Mango Wine 56 Days 390g 7.0 546g 9.8 Strawberry Wine 56 Days 360g 6.4 504g 9.0 Followed by all other wines in descending order of fruit/wine price. Note that although the large milks make gold quality cheeses directly, the final aging step is both 50% of the total value increase and 50% of the required time, so the g/day remains the same. The prices above assume no relevant skills. Choosing Artisan raises the base prices of all cask-aged products by the same percentage, so while the overall values will increase, the relative order of g/day stays the same. Choosing Rancher, however, will only increase the price of the cheeses, raising Cheese to ~19.7 g/day and Goat Cheese to ~34.3 g/day, making it better than Ancient Fruit Wine in this case.

Livin' Off The Land From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Livin' Off The Land  Welcome to 'Livin' Off The Land'. We're back again with another tip for y'all. Now listen up: Livin' Off The Land is a show that airs every Monday and Thursday on the Player's TV. It provides tips and tricks to new players to help them get acquainted with the game's mechanics. After two years, the host announces his retirement, and the episodes repeat. Two of the tips are repeated within the two-year cycle. Original Air Date Tip 1 Spring, Year 1 This one's for all you greenhorns out there: chop wood and search for wild forage to earn some cash while waiting on your first harvest! 4 Spring, Year 1 This one's for you folks living in Stardew Valley. Check for Spring Onion southwest of town, where the river meets the ocean. You can sometimes find a whole bunch growing right out of the dirt. 8 Spring, Year 1 Let's talk fences. Fences are useful for keeping weeds at bay and protecting your crops. They also let farmers contain their livestock. Fences break down after a while, but stone, iron, and hardwood fences last a lot longer than basic wood! 11 Spring, Year 1 Woes from crows? Sounds like you need a scarecrow! Placing a scarecrow on your farm deters crows from a pretty good distance. Make sure you protect your valuable crops! One more thing... need a bigger backpack to hold all your stuff? Check your local general store. 15 Spring, Year 1 15 Spring, Year 2 It's salmonberry season! All across the countryside, bushes are teeming with juicy little berries, and they're free for the taking! Harvesting them is a great way to earn some extra cash. 18 Spring, Year 1 Ah, refreshing rain... a Farmer's best friend! When it rains, you don't have to water your crops. Use this to your advantage! 22 Spring, Year 1 Get your hands on a fishin' pole and sell your catch! Fishing is a great way to make a little extra cash when you have some down time. The distance your bobber lands from any dry land determines what kinds of fish you'll hook... as well as the location, season, time of day, and weather! 25 Spring, Year 1 Fruit trees. They take an entire season to grow, so plan ahead! If the area directly surrounding your new tree isn't clear, it will interfere with growth. Once your fruit tree is mature, it'll produce delicious fruit for you every day while in season. Better start savin' up! 1 Summer, Year 1 Summer's here, along with a whole slew of new crops to plant! Take hops, for example. The vines take a while to grow, but once they're mature they can be harvested every day. Good luck! 4 Summer, Year 1 Here's a rundown of the fish you can only find in summer: Dorado, found in forest rivers during the day. Rainbow Trout, found in forest rivers and in the mountains during the day. Pufferfish, found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And Octopus, found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can! 8 Summer, Year 1 Let's talk corn. It's an unusual crop because it lasts for two seasons! That's right, while most crops die when the season changes, corn lives on. You can grow it in both summer and fall. Now, get out there and plant some corn! 11 Summer, Year 1 Starting tomorrow, an unusual amount of shells and corals are expected to wash up on beaches all around the world. I'm no scientist, but I've heard it's something to do with crab mating season. At any rate, you could make some good coin combing your local beach. 15 Summer, Year 1 Got a spa in your town? Relax and hold still in the steaming hot water to replenish your energy. Ahh... feels good, don't it? 18 Summer, Year 1 Summer's known for its lightning storms. If you know how to craft a lightning rod, you can harvest the electricity and create battery packs. These can be sold or used for crafting! 22 Summer, Year 1 Most towns have a seasonal calendar in front of the general store. It's a good idea to check on that now and then to get a feel for what's going on in the community. Make sure to check for any job postings as well! 25 Summer, Year 1 Fall's almost here! It's arguably the most lucrative season for farmers, so make sure you're saving some money to buy new seeds. If you haven't upgraded your watering can by now, it's probably a good idea. 1 Fall, Year 1 Let's talk sunflowers. When you harvest them you'll not only get a nice flower, but you'll likely get some seeds as well. You can replant those seeds or sell them. I'm sold! 4 Fall, Year 1 If you're a farmer in a small town, it's likely you'll be invited to create a "grange display" at some point. Typically, a grange display consists of 9 items that best showcase your talents. Shoot for high quality, high value items and make sure to have a variety as well. Fish, minerals, artisan goods, fruit, and vegetables are all good to have! 8 Fall, Year 1 8 Fall, Year 2 It's blackberry season! Bushes across the countryside are overflowing with ripe fruit. Just go outside and see for yourself! 11 Fall, Year 1 Fish Focus: Salmon. Salmon return to their spawning ground in fall to lay eggs. That means the rivers are chock-full of them! You can only find them in fall, so get out there and cast your pole. 15 Fall, Year 1 Got any tappers? Crafty foragers known how to build 'em. You can attach them to the wild trees that grow all over. Maple trees yield maple syrup, oak trees provide resin, and pine trees produce pine tar. Syrup's the most valuable but all tree products have their uses! 18 Fall, Year 1 Winter's almost here. Make sure you're prepared to feed your animals hay over the winter, because they don't like going outside in the cold. Also, your grass won't keep growing after that first frost. Each silo can hold 240 pieces of hay, so make sure to do the math and figure out if you need to build any more! 22 Fall, Year 1 Fish Focus: Walleye. You can find this fish on rainy evenings during the fall and winter. It can be found in any freshwater location. 25 Fall, Year 1 Winter's coming soon... and that means your farming operations will be coming to a halt. No crops grow in winter, unless you're lucky enough to have a greenhouse. But there's still plenty to do! More next time. 1 Winter, Year 1 Winter... A time when all the world goes quiet. Now's a great time to do some mining, fishing and gathering. Upgrade your tools in preparation for a productive spring. Or get your local carpenter to build something on your farm! Stock up on resources, upgrade, and prepare for the next year. 4 Winter, Year 1 Wondering how to get your hands on 'Refined Quartz'? Just put a regular old quartz in the furnace. You'll need a lump of coal to fuel the fire. 8 Winter, Year 1 Find any tree seeds while chopping wood? You can plant those in the ground and a new tree will grow. Get creative! 11 Winter, Year 1 There's a couple fish you can only find in winter... Squid and Lingcod. Squid can be caught from the ocean in the evening. Lingcod can be found in fresh water all day. Of course, there's rumors of extremely rare and unique fish that can only be found in particular seasons, but I don't have any information on them. 15 Winter, Year 1 Let's talk geodes. Geodes are hollow stones that often contain valuable minerals. A blacksmith can crack them open for you for a fee. Now, there's different kinds of geodes... and each one yields a different subset of minerals. The rare "omni-geode", however, can contain every kind of mineral. 18 Winter, Year 1 If you really want to make someone happy, give them their favorite gift on their birthday! Trust me. 22 Winter, Year 1 Ever see three little brown stems poking up out of the ground? They're hard to spot, sometimes. But if you dig on that spot, you'll always find something. Don't ask me how it works. 25 Winter, Year 1 Ever had the urge to dig around in your neighbor's trash? Ew! Hey, if that's your thing, just don't do it when anyone's around. If they notice you, they'll be seriously grossed out, and it'll harm your friendship. Well, unless they're into the same thing. 1 Spring, Year 2 Well, a new year has arrived. Keep your eyes peeled for any new kinds of seeds being stocked in your local general store. Hopefully you upgraded your tools during the winter and you're ready for a productive year! 4 Spring, Year 2 Fish Focus: Eel. Eels can be caught from the ocean in the spring and fall, during rainy evenings. 8 Spring, Year 2 Got a kitchen? Cooking is a great way to enhance your abilities. Not only do they provide a convenient source of energy, but many dishes temporarily increase your skills, speed, and more! Smells good, don't it? 11 Spring, Year 2 Item Spotlight: Crab Pot. Experienced anglers know how to craft crab pots. Despite the name, the pots can be used to catch a wide variety of aquatic critters, in both fresh and salt water. Just place your crab pot in the water and load with bait. Come back the next day and check on it to see what you caught. You'll need to load it with bait again to catch more. 18 Spring, Year 2 Let's talk honey. No, not you, silly. I'm talking about the sweet product made by our friends, the bees. Here's the thing... if you've got some flowers blooming near your beehouse your bees can produce flavored honey. Otherwise you'll only get 'wild honey'. Pretty sweet, huh? 22 Spring, Year 2 Here's a tip for you adventurers out there... don't forget your weapon's special attack! Swords can block incoming attacks, which is very useful when slimes are jumping at you. Clubs can pound the ground, sending enemies flying... and with a dagger you can perform a super-quick triple-strike attack! Be safe. 25 Spring, Year 2 I'd like to talk about the famous Adventurer's Guild near Pelican Town. The guild leader, Marlon, has a nice rewards program for anyone brave enough to slay monsters in the local caves. Adventurers will receive powerful items in exchange for slaying large quantities of monsters. There's a poster on the wall with more details. Very cool! 1 Summer, Year 2 I've heard that some folks stand near moving trains to gather any debris that falls off. Wow... the things people will do for a freebie! 4 Summer, Year 2 Animal Spotlight: Pig. In these parts, pigs are trained to sniff out valuable truffles. You've got to let the porkers outside and be patient... they'll work their magic when they're good and ready. Make oil out of the truffles to maximize your profit. 8 Summer, Year 2 Here's a reminder of the fish you can only find in summer: Dorado, found in forest rivers during the day. Rainbow Trout, found in forest rivers and in the mountains during the day. Pufferfish, found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And Octopus, found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can! 11 Summer, Year 2 Fish Focus: Super Cucumber. You can find this rare fish in the ocean. It only comes out in the evening, during summer and fall. 15 Summer, Year 2 I know it's hard... but stop worrying so much about your horse! You can leave them anywhere and they'll make their way back home. They're very smart and independent animals! 18 Summer, Year 2 Here's an idea... start a wild tree orchard! Put tappers on those trees and harvest the valuable syrup. Or don't! See if I care. 22 Summer, Year 2 Item Spotlight: Keg. The classic use of a keg is to make wine out of grapes. But did you know you can make wine out of any fruit? Yep. You can also make juice out of veggies. 25 Summer, Year 2 Do you have a journal? Don't forget to check it from time to time. It's easy to forget that you've written something important down. 1 Fall, Year 2 If you managed to get your hands on a 'rare seed', now's the time to plant it. Although it's said to take all season to grow, reliable sources have told me it actually takes just 24 days. The end result is rumored to be the sweetest fruit in the entire world. 4 Fall, Year 2 Some farmers have reported strange things happening when large fields of cauliflower, melon, or pumpkin reach maturity. Hmmm. I can't verify it, myself. 11 Fall, Year 2 Looking to get married? You're going to need a Mermaid's Pendant. Everyone this side of the Gem Sea knows what it means when you give them a Mermaid's Pendant. Getting your hands on such a pendant can be tricky. Every region seems to have their own custom, but it always has something to do with the beach or ocean. 15 Fall, Year 2 Item Spotlight: Recycling Machine. Have you been catching a lot of junk while fishing? It's all too common in this day and age. Well, with a recycling machine you can turn those items into something useful. Just place your trash items into the machine and let it do its thing. Each type of trash produces different kinds of items. 18 Fall, Year 2 Fish Focus: Albacore. This fish can be found either early in the morning or at night. Look for it in the ocean in fall or winter. 22 Fall, Year 2 Fish Focus: Woodskip, sandfish, and scorpion carp. The woodskip is said to only live deep in the woods. The sandfish and scorpion carp can only be found in desert oases. 25 Fall, Year 2 It's just a couple days until communities around the Ferngill Republic celebrate Spirit's Eve! One tradition you may not know of is the search for the golden pumpkin. If your town has a haunted maze, then you can be sure there's a golden pumpkin hidden somewhere. Those things are valuable! 1 Winter, Year 2 Folks, take my advice. You're going to need a nursery in your house before you can have kids. Baby needs a crib! 4 Winter, Year 2 Item Spotlight: Crystalarium. This amazing machine can create infinite copies of any kind of gemstone. Just place the gemstone you'd like to copy in the machine let it do its thing. It might take a while, but hey... that's pure profit! 8 Winter, Year 2 If you have adult barn animals, and space left in your barn... there's always a chance one of your animals could give birth. It's something to keep in mind. 11 Winter, Year 2 Fish Focus: Catfish. This relatively rare fish comes out of hiding when it rains. You'll find them living in rivers beside towns, where they enjoy feeding on whatever scraps end up in the water. They don't like hot weather, so don't bother fishing for them in the summer! 15 Winter, Year 2 Item Spotlight: Worm Bin. Need an endless supply of bait? Build yourself a worm bin. Once you've got one going, you'll get a few pieces of bait every single day. 18 Winter, Year 2 Underneath all that snow, spring seeds are champing at the bit to start their new lives in the sun. Don't be surprised when spring rolls around and your farm needs some tidying up! 22 Winter, Year 2 If you've got your hands on a gold pan, keep an eye out for something sparkly in the water. There's often good ore in there, free for the taking! 25 Winter, Year 2 Folks, I've got an announcement to make. This is the last new episode of Livin' Off The Land before my retirement. I've had a good time, and I'll miss you folks. Oh, and I've been told the station's going to start playing reruns next year. Take care! Trivia Despite stating on Spring 22, year 2 that daggers have a three-hit combo, they actually strike four times.

Three seasonal tracks exist for each season. Only one can be played on a given day. The track will not loop when finished, but if no music is playing, the track will trigger when entering any seasonal-track area (except for Town, see below, and given the weather and time conditions are met). The same conditions apply to the Ginger Island track. Some locations are silent, always or on given conditions (cutscenes and ambient sounds apart): The following location are always silent: Basement Room of the Wizard, Beach, Blacksmith, Casino, Elliott's Cabin, Fish Shop and its back room, Jungle, JojaMart, Mutant Bug Lair, Pirate Cove (when empty), Qi's Walnut Room, Quarry Mine, Sewers, Skull Cavern entrance, Spa, Tunnel, Witch's Hut, Witch's Swamp The Railroad is silent except during Winter. Outside areas and most stores are silent during Rain and Storm days. If a non-seasonal-track is playing, and the player enters a seasonal-track area (Town apart), there will be silence (e.g., entering the Forest from Town when the Town theme is playing, exiting the Adventurer's Guild, the Secret Woods, the Wizard's Tower...). Exiting Treehouse makes exception to the rule: the track playing before the entering plays. In Pelican Town, music triggering works as follows: If the seasonal track is playing, it continues playing when entering town. If no track is playing and the player enters Town from the Bus Stop, the Forest or the Mountain, the seasonal track will be triggered if it is before 12 PM. Otherwise, the Town theme will be triggered (given other weather, season and time conditions are met). If the player enters Town from the Beach, the Sewers, or by exiting the Blacksmith, the Community Center, Harvey's Clinic, JojaMart, the Movie Theater or the Museum, the Town theme will be triggered (given the weather, season and time conditions are met). It will also be triggered when exiting any town building if no music was previously playing. The Town theme auto-loops while staying in town or one of its buildings (even after 6 PM, but the track will then abruptly stop at 7 PM if outside and at 8 PM if in a building). The track will not change, nor will be silenced, entering the following locations: Any interior on the Farm (buildings and the cave), the Mines entrance, the Tent and most Town houses (1 River Road, 1 Willow Lane, 2 Willow Lane, Mayor's Manor, Pierre's General Store, Stardrop Saloon before 5 PM, Trailer) Marnie's Ranch and Carpenter's Shop. In those, Country Shop triggers on entering only if no music was previously playing. Community Center on entering, but the Town theme will play after exiting. The Volcano Dungeon entrance, if the previous track is one of the three volcano tracks. In The Mines and the Skull Cavern, music triggering is dependent of mine level and time since music last played. On floor 2, music will always begin playing. On floors 1, 11, 40, 80, and 120, the game music will stop playing. On floors 31-39, 71-79, 111-119, and floors that are divisible by 5, the game music will continue playing but no new tracks will be played. On all remaining floors, there is a 50% chance to play a new song if it has been at least 2.5 minutes since the last song in the Mines began. Taking the elevator to a different section of the Mines will also cause the game music to stop playing.[9] Trivia In addition to ConcernedApe's official Bandcamp account, he has at least two other Bandcamp accounts: https://evergreenmultimedia.bandcamp.com/ and a secret account, that he may reveal in "another decade".[10] References ?

It doubles the sell price of the fish while retaining quality, as well as multiplying the energy and health restoration by 1.5. Smoked fish benefit from the Fisher and Angler professions, as well as the Artisan profession. Thus, if the player does not have the Artisan profession, the Smoked Fish will always sell for 2 times as much as the original fish. If the player has the Artisan profession, the Smoked Fish will always sell for 2.8 times as much as the original fish. Because Smoked fish is an Artisan Good, it can be sold at Pierre's General Store but cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop. Contents 1 Gifting 2 Bundles 3 Quests 4

For information about the Fishing Skill and Mechanics, see Fishing. For an index to the completed fish collection, see Collections. See also: Tackle, Bait This page provides fishing strategy information for Stardew Valley. Basics of Strategy The availability of many types of fish can depend on various factors: the location of the fishing spot, the season, the time of day, and the weather. Match the fishing location to current conditions as necessary to get a chance to catch certain type(s) of fish. Locations Fishing spots are commonly broken up into ocean, lake, and river types. However, while most fishing spots in a similar body of water will share catches, the map also plays a role. For instance, the river in Cindersap Forest is not the same as the river in Pelican Town. Ponds usually have a smaller selection of fish, if any, compared to larger bodies of water and the selection is usually specific to the map where the pond is found. Note that generally, the less fish there are in a certain location, the more likely it is that trash will be caught. The Sewers The Sewers are an easy and productive fishing location, especially to level up the fishing skill or farm treasure. Carp is the least difficult fish to catch in the game and it is the only fish in the sewers (except for a legendary fish). Therefore, almost every cast of the line results in either an immediate item reward or a quick Carp catch. Bobber Position In general, it is optimal to cast the bobber as far from land as possible to maximize the Fishing Zone. Longer casting distances are important, but also casting east/west instead of north/south can improve the fishing zone, as can fishing in wide-open water. In addition to affecting the quality of the fish, Fishing Zone also affects the chances of catching certain fish over other ones. While all non-Legendary fish can be caught in tiles that have a zone of 1, a lot of the more difficult and profitable fish have a higher chance to be caught at higher-zone locations. Bubbles greatly increase the rate at which fish bite and can also alter the relative chances of each fish type at the location. Careful placement of the bobber on the edge of the bubbles allows the bubble bonus to be used in any of the adjacent tiles, providing some ability to optimize the Fishing Zone. Fishing Skill Fishing level is important because each increase in the fishing level increases the fishing bar size by 8 pixels. The longer the fishing bar is, the easier it is to catch fish. The fishing bar will continue to increase by this amount even as the player goes beyond level 10 (with buffs). This means the bar can get much bigger than it naturally would be even at fishing level 10. Using a fishing rod with the Master enchant will also increase the fishing bar size by 8 pixels. Each Cork Bobber used will increase the fishing bar size by 24 pixels. Using Deluxe Bait increases the fishing bar size by 12 pixels. Catching Difficult Fish This concept of the fishing bar getting bigger is especially useful when trying to catch extremely hard fish such as the Legendary Fish and the Octopus. Reaching Fishing level 10, using an iridium rod with a Cork Bobber and with the Master enchant, and eating food (better prepared with Qi Seasoning) that provides a temporary fishing buff (e.g., Seafoam Pudding) will all help make catching these difficult fish much more manageable. The Trap Bobber is also a great combination with a large fishing bar, as it significantly reduces the speed at which difficult fish escape. The Blessing Of Waters can also be used to make catching the fish easier, as it decreases the difficulty of Legendary Fish by 25% and non-Legendary Fish (except Carp) by 50% and causes the progress bar to decrease 50% slower when the fish isn't being reeled in. Fishing Zones The following images show the Fishing Zone based on the location where the bobber lands, color coded as: Note that these maps are not valid on iOS and Android because of a bug.

Inventory From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search The Inventory consists of the contents of the player's backpack. It allows the player to carry items as they travel around the map. The inventory is organized into rows of 12, and the player starts with one row initially available. One row can be selected at a time to provide immediate access to items and equipment, and this subsection of the inventory is commonly referred to as the hotbar. It is possible to select different items in the hotbar for use by using pressing the number key associated with that slot, or using the scroll wheel. The game menu (press ESCAPE or E), displays the entire contents of the backpack in its leftmost tab. For this reason it is sometimes called the Inventory Menu. The hotbar is shown as the top row of this menu, and if upgraded the other rows will be shown below it. This menu gives the player the means to move items between the slots inside the backpack, or to split or combine stacks of items. To select one item in a stack using mouse & keyboard, right-click on it. To divide the stack in half, shift + right-click on it. (See also: Controls, Mobile Controls.) Note that in singleplayer, opening the inventory menu pauses the clock. The inventory can be expanded twice in stages of 12 items each by purchasing backpack upgrades at Pierre's General Store. Extra slots from backpack extension do not grant direct access, but simply add to the number of items that can travel with the player. To gain immediate access, items must be moved from the lower row(s) into the upper row using the menu. Certain game activities that involve transferring items give the player access to the entire inventory. These include interacting with an open chest or a shop menu, or donating items at the Community Center or Museum. Items that cannot be sold to a shop or donated will be grayed out (note that Pierre and Willy will only buy back items pertaining to their respective type of shop). Controls change somewhat during these activities. Moving items within the inventory is often restricted, and a mouse click on an inventory item can sell it to a shopkeeper, so careful control is required for guaranteeing one's intended actions.

Fish Pond From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. Fish Pond Raise fish and harvest their produce. Fish multiply over time. Information Build cost: data-sort-value="5000">5,000g Build materials: Stone (200) Seaweed (5) Green Algae (5) Size: 5x5 The Fish Pond is a type of farm building purchasable from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop. It takes two days to build and occupies a 5x5 tile space. The following can be placed in a Fish Pond: All fish caught with a Fishing Rod or a Crab Pot, except Legendary fish and Qi's Extended Family Coral and Sea Urchin (for simplicity, these are included when referencing fish in a Fish Pond, even though they are otherwise considered forage and not fish) Golden Animal Cracker, once per Fish Pond to double the fish pond's output of its normal product The following cannot be placed in a Fish Pond: Legendary fish (Legend, Mutant Carp, Crimsonfish, Glacierfish, and Angler) Qi's Extended Family (Ms. Angler, Glacierfish Jr., Son of Crimsonfish, Radioactive Carp and Legend II) Green Algae, Seaweed, White Algae, Sea Jelly, River Jelly, and Cave Jelly, which count towards the Fishing achievements but are otherwise not considered fish Fish in a Fish Pond have a chance to produce Roe or certain other items. A Golden Animal Cracker can be thrown into the fish pond to double its output. The chance of producing an item and the item produced is determined randomly based on the contents and population of the Fish Pond. Also, fish reproduce up to the limit of their Fish Pond, except Tiger Trout, which do not reproduce. The time it takes for a new fish to spawn varies from 1 to 5 days, depending on the fish. If a Fish Pond produces any amount of Roe, the game generates a random number between 0 and 1. If it is less than 0.2, the quantity of the Roe produced increases by 1. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.2, at which point the chance for the quantity of the Roe to increase ends. This, on average, will give 0.25 extra Roe. This increase is taken into account before the doubling from the Golden Animal Cracker.[1] Fish can be harvested one at a time by casting the fishing pole into the pond. Harvested fish are always of regular quality (even if higher quality fish were thrown into the pond). Although energy is consumed when casting the rod into the pond, a simplified mechanism is used for catching the fish: fish are caught automatically (without the minigame), no bait is consumed, and the durability of tackle is not depleted. The fish do not count towards the Fish Collection, and no fishing experience is gained by harvesting fish from a pond. However, fishing experience is gained when completing fish pond quests or collecting items produced by a pond. Each pond holds only one type of fish at a time. Ponds are populated by holding the desired fish (with the inventory menu closed) and right-clicking on the pond to "throw" the fish in. Attempting to throw in a legendary fish yields a prompt saying "The [fish] wouldn't be happy in there." Attempting to throw a fish into a pond that already contains a different type of fish yields a prompt saying that type of fish doesn't want to live in a pond of another type. The standard initial capacity of a pond is three fish. Several rare fish have an initial capacity of just one fish, namely Blobfish, Ghostfish, Ice Pips, Lava Eels, Slimejacks, Stonefish, Sturgeons, Void Salmons, and Woodskips. Conversely, Tiger Trout, Sea Urchins, and Coral have an initial capacity of ten. Contents 1 Empty Pond 2 Quests 3 Produce 4 Responses 5 Notes 6 References 7

Here are some common answers to get you started. Feel free to ask beginner questions here rather than making a full post on the subreddit. General questions Common gameplay questions Tips and guides Official wiki, website, and forums Stardew Valley Discord Using mods Previous pinned posts, subreddit announcements, and new rules Want to look through old FAQ threads for an answer to your question? Here is our old FAQ thread Animated Custom Flairs and Prestige Flairs Community Updates and Inclusivity Reminders /r/StardewValley left /r/ popular and /r/ all After user voting, AI generated content will be added to the list of removed topics Simple questions are welcome Content warning rules New mods announcement Metrics for IRL posts and relativity Userflairs for bot bouncers Very common FAQs / removed topics [insert item here] showed up on my farm, what is it? It could be a a few different items that are relatively rare but have a high enough spawn rate that they are included in our removed topics. Check out our list of removed topics here Game updates What was in the last update? See release notes for PC, for consoles, and for mobile. See also a table of which version and features each platform has. Are future releases planned? Stardew Valley 1.5 was released on PC in late December 2020 and console in February 2021. Android/iOS received the 1.5 update in early January 2023. Stardew Valley 1.6 released on 19 March 2024 on PC. Console release to follow ASAP. Does every platform get the same content/updates? Mostly yes. Updates are developed for Linux/Mac/Windows first, then ported to other platforms. There are customizations for each platform (like tap to move on mobile), but otherwise content is identical across all platforms. See also a table of which version and features each platform has. The exceptions are PS Vita (which won't get any further content updates due to platform limitations), and Android/iOS (which will continue getting all updates, but don't support multiplayer or Chinese translations). Is Stardew Valley on XBox GamePass? Stardew Valley is on XBox GamePass as of December 2, 2021. See here for details. Multiplayer How does multiplayer work? See Multiplayer on the wiki. Is crossplay supported? All PC players can play together, whether they're on Linux/Mac/Windows or GOG/Steam. Console crossplay isn't supported, and mobile versions don't have multiplayer. Is split-screen supported? Yep, split-screen was added on PC and console in Stardew Valley 1.5. Will Android/iOS get multiplayer? There are no current plans for multiplayer on mobile (including split-screen multiplayer). Will the 1.6 update apply to my current game? Yes! New updates always apply to existing saves. Other Can I transfer saves between devices? You can transfer saves between Android, iOS, and PC (Linux/Mac/Windows). Consoles unfortunately don't let you access the save files. The Switch version also has a different format that's not compatible with other platforms (the format used by other consoles is unknown). How do I take a screenshot of my full farm? See this guide to taking farm screenshots. If I buy the game on one platform, can I get it for free on a different one? If you buy it on PC, you get the Linux + macOS + Windows versions; if you buy it on PS4, you get the PS4 + PS Vita versions. Otherwise each platform is a different edition with separate development, so you'll need to buy it again if you want it on a different platform. Where can I report bugs? If you use mods, see the troubleshooting guide first. If you use mods and the bug disappears when playing without them (by running Stardew Valley.exe directly in your game folder), report it to r/SMAPI or see Modding:Help. If it happens without mods, report it in the official bug report forum, which the game developers keep an eye on. How do I use or create mods? See the pinned thread in r/SMAPI for more info, and feel free to ask questions in r/SMAPI!

Master Slingshot From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Master Slingshot Requires stones for ammo. Information Type: Slingshot Source: Chest on Floor 70 of The Mines Damage: Depends on ammo used Critical Strike Chance: .02 Adventurer's Guild Purchase Price: data-sort-value="1000 ">1,000g Sell Price: Cannot be sold The Master Slingshot is a slingshot weapon that can be obtained from the chest on floor 70 of The Mines. After that, it can be purchased at the Adventurer's Guild for data-sort-value="1000">1,000g. Despite its description, many items other than Stone can be used as ammunition with the Master Slingshot. Unlike most weapons, using a Master Slingshot on a villager will decrease friendship with them by 30 points. Using a master slingshot on the cat or dog will produce a "hate" dialogue bubble, but will not decrease friendship. Ammunition To equip a slingshot with ammunition, select the ammunition, then Right-Click on the slingshot. The type of ammunition used determines the damage dealt, according to the following formulas: Slingshot: Damage = AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1] Master Slingshot: Damage = 2 * (AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1]) With the worst ammo (i.e., Fruits, Vegetables, or Eggs), a Slingshot can deal 1-3 and a Master Slingshot can deal 2-6 damage. With the best ammo, Iridium Ore and a Slingshot can deal 25-101 damage while a Master Slingshot can deal 50-202 damage. The following items can be used as ammunition: Item AmmoMultiplier Slingshot Damage Master Slingshot Damage All Fruits  All Vegetables  All Eggs 1 1-3 2-6 Coal 15 8-31 16-62 Copper Ore 10 5-21 10-42 Explosive Ammo 20 10-41 20-82 Gold Ore 30 15-61 30-122 Iridium Ore 50 25-101 50-202 Iron Ore 20 10-41 20-82 Stone 5 3-11 6-22 Wood 2 1-5 2-10 Notes The clipping glitch that allows the player to enter the normally unreachable space around a map area does not work with slingshots.

Deluxe Speed-Gro can be placed on tilled soil before or after planting a seed, or at any stage of crop growth. It does not reduce time between harvests for multi-harvest crops. Applying Deluxe Speed-Gro days after planting a seed still decreases the time it takes to fully grow, but it reduces a fixed amount of days per stage for each crop regardless of the day it's applied, and the reduction in stages that the crop has already passed will not retroactively apply. Combined with the fact that the reduction disproportionately affects earlier stages more, this means that its reduction to the rest of the growth time is much lower than the advertised percentage of 25%.[2].

Animal Products Profitability From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Not all processing of animal products results in a price gain. This page lists the profitability of processing animal products at different quality levels and Farming Professions. Note that regular chicken eggs always produce normal quality Mayonnaise and Large Eggs produce gold quality mayonnaise. Duck Mayonnaise, Void Mayonnaise, and Dinosaur Mayonnaise are always normal quality. The quality of these eggs is not a factor. However, Ostrich Eggs produce 10 jars of Mayonnaise, where the quality of the Mayonnaise will be equal to the quality of the Ostrich Egg used. Similarly, normal sized Milk always produces normal quality Cheese and Large Milk always produces gold quality Cheese. Normal sized Goat Milk always produces normal quality Goat Cheese and Large Goat Milk always produces gold quality Goat Cheese. The quality of the milk is not a factor. When using quality Wool with a Loom, there is a chance of receiving two Cloth: Silver quality wool = 10% chance Gold quality wool = 50% chance Iridium quality wool = 100% chance Mayonnaise produced using Ostrich Eggs and Cloth are the only artisan goods in the game that are actually affected by the quality level of the input. When to process animal products Below is a quick reference table indicating when to process animal products, without regard to aging in casks. Aging cheese or goat cheese in a cask will almost always result in profit. This table also does not take into account the chance of obtaining 2 Cloth from 1 Wool of gold quality. Obtaining 2 cloth from 1 wool is guaranteed only if the cloth is iridium quality. Looming a gold wool can result in a net loss if only 1 cloth is produced. However, in the long run the chance for extra cloth makes processing wool profitable on average for all quality levels (with iridium wool producing 2 cloth, gold 1.5 on average, and silver 1.1).

Stone Chest From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Stone Chest A place to store your items. Information Source Crafting Sell Price Cannot be sold Crafting Recipe Source "Robin's Resource Rush" Special Order Ingredients Stone (50) See also: Chest, Big Chest, Big Stone Chest. The Stone Chest is a craftable storage item that holds up to 36 different types of items, much like the wooden Chest. The recipe is obtained by mail after completing the Special Order "Robin's Resource Rush". A maximum of 999 identical items can be stacked into a single slot in a Stone Chest. Items do not decompose in Stone Chests. Stone Chests can be left in many different places in Stardew Valley. However, if a Stone Chest is left on a walking pathway for a villager, it will be pushed out of their way. See "Crafted goods outside the farm" for maps of areas safe from villager pathing. An empty stone chest can be picked up and returned to inventory by hitting it with any tool, or hitting repeatedly with an empty hand. Stone chests with any items inside cannot be picked up until emptied; however if a filled chest is hit repeatedly with just an empty hand, it will be pushed one tile away from the player (note that tools will not work for pushing). If that tile is not valid for item placement, the chest can jump to the nearest acceptable tile, such as behind the player, to a diagonally adjacent tile, or over other items to a valid one. Coloring When opened, Stone Chests have a color bar above their inventory window which allows players to select a different color for the Stone Chest. This can be changed at anytime without cost. There are 20 colors available to select in the color picker. The default color is equivalent to the "white" color in the color bar.

Clara Mullner From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Clara cradles baby Alex. Clara is Alex's deceased mother. During Alex's eight heart event, he states that she died 12 years ago, sometime in the summer. When she died, Alex had to move in with his grandparents, George and Evelyn, who were Clara's parents. During Alex's memory of her, Clara is seen holding Alex as a baby and singing to him. She has brown hair, with two blue hair bands, and is wearing a purple shirt. In the memory, Alex is wrapped in a blue blanket with the letter "A" sewn on it and has a green pacifier in his mouth. Her relationship with Alex's father is assumed to have been strained since Alex describes him as being either absent or drunk. Clara's surname is unknown; it may or may not be "Mullner". The name "Mullner" is used in only three places in the game: In Penny's Two Heart event, Penny speaks to George, calling him "Mr. Mullner".

Information Source Pierre's  Crafting  Bone Mill Sell Price data-sort-value="20">20g Recipe Recipe Source(s) Farming Level 3 Ingredients Pine Tar (1) Moss (5) Produces 5 Speed-Gro per craft Speed-Gro is a Fertilizer that speeds crop growth by 10% (or a total of 20% with the Agriculturist Profession)[1]. It can be crafted, obtained from a Bone Mill, or purchased from Pierre's for data-sort-value="100">100g starting on Spring 15th of year 1.[2] Twenty Speed-Gro is the reward for completing the Spring Crops Bundle in the Pantry. Speed-Gro can be placed on tilled soil before or after planting a seed, or at any stage of crop growth. It does not reduce time between harvests for multi-harvest crops. Applying Speed-Gro days after planting a seed still decreases the time it takes to fully grow, but it reduces a fixed amount of days per stage for each crop regardless of the day it's applied, and the reduction in stages that the crop has already passed will not retroactively apply. Combined with the fact that the reduction disproportionately affects earlier stages more, this means that its reduction to the rest of the growth time is much lower than the advertised percentage of 10%.[3].

Crit. Power From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Crit. Power (short for Critical Power) is a Combat statistic. When you hit a critical strike, this stat will deal additional damage to your enemy. A critical strike in itself does additional damage to an enemy. A special sound plays when hitting a critical strike, and the damage numbers that pop up show the greater damage amount. Bonus damage done by critical strikes is equal to base damage × (3 + Crit. Power / 50). Critical strike damage can further be increased by the Jade Ring and by innate enchantments. This "extra multiplier" starts out as 1. Each Jade Ring adds 0.1 to this multiplier, and an innate enchantment adds 0.5 to 1.5, depending on level. This means that two Jade Rings and a +75 Crit. Power innate enchantment will multiply the damage by 2.7. The Desperado Profession will further multiply this damage by 2. Example: A normal attack using the Lava Katana can do 55-64 damage. Assuming a normal attack has a base damage value of 60 on a bat with a defense value of 1 would result in 59 damage. As the Lava Katana has 25 crit power, this would result in 60×(3+25/50) bonus damage which would make the final damage 60×(3+25/50)=210 damage.

Bee House From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Bee House Place outside and wait for delicious honey! (Except in Winter). Information Source Crafting Season Spring  Summer  Fall Sell Price Cannot be sold Crafting Recipe Source Farming (Level 3) Ingredients Wood (40) Coal (8) Iron Bar (1) Maple Syrup (1) The Bee House is a type of Artisan Equipment used to make Honey. A Bee House is the reward for completing the Fall Crops Bundle in the Pantry. Four Bee Houses can be obtained as the 19th prize from the Prize Machine (50% chance). To make honey, place a Bee House on the farm during any season but winter, and wait 4 nights. Bee houses can be placed indoors (e.g., in the Greenhouse) but will not produce honey there, regardless of any flowers within range. Bee houses placed outside the farm will produce wild honey every 4 days, but they will be destroyed if they are placed in a villager's path. A fully-grown and unharvested flower within 5 tiles of a Bee House (including those grown in Garden Pots) will cause it to produce flower honey, which always sells for more than flowerless Wild Honey. Flowers that are normally foraged (i.e., Crocus and Sweet Pea) do not affect the honey. Additionally, a Dandelion or Daffodil will not affect the honey as these items are classified as forage rather than flowers. The type of honey is established the moment it is harvested. If a Bee House has produced flower honey, but the flower is harvested before the honey, the honey will become wild honey. Similarly, if a Bee House has produced flowerless wild honey, but the honey is harvested after a flower bloomed in range, the harvested honey will be flower honey.

Grass From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Grass Information Seed Grass Starter Growth Time Varies Season Spring Summer Fall Grass is a naturally-occurring dynamic resource on the player's farm. Many unconfined fields of grass can be found there at the start of the game. Each day, it is likely that existing grass will expand and grow into adjacent unoccupied tiles. And occasionally, grass spawns randomly on any unoccupied tile on the farm. The player can choose to plant a new tile with Grass Starter also, creating a fully grown patch of new grass. Grass continues to sprout and grow throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons. In winter, it goes dormant until the next spring. Grass can be cut using a scythe, sword, or dagger. If the player has built a Silo, each patch of grass cut with the basic Scythe has a 50% chance of producing Hay, which is automatically added to the contents of the silo. With a Golden Scythe, there's a 75% chance, and with an Iridium Scythe, there's a 100% chance. During winter, hay chances for all scythes are reduced by 67%.[1] Once all the farm's silos are full, no more hay is produced or stored until there is available room. Cutting grass with a sword or dagger does not produce hay at any time. It is recommended that enough hay be stored before winter to feed the farm's animals for the entire 28-day season, since cutting grass in winter produces less hay than in the growing seasons. If cutting grass is not enough, hay can be purchased at Marnie's Ranch for data-sort-value="50">50g each. Marnie occasionally sends a gift of 30 hay in the mail, at any friendship level greater than 0 points. Contents 1 Blue Grass 2 Tips 3 Notes 4 Propagation 5 References 6

Clint gives the player the blueprint for the Furnace in a cutscene the morning after collecting at least 1 Copper Ore. Exit the farmhouse between 6am and 11:30am to trigger the cutscene. The Copper Ore can come from anywhere, including from a fishing treasure chest or from purchasing it from Clint directly. If you have not yet met Clint when he comes to give you the blueprint, the meeting will count as an introduction. A furnace is the reward for completing the Blacksmith's Bundle in the Boiler Room. A furnace is used to change a Bouquet into a Wilted Bouquet. The furnace will occasionally make the same sound as placing down wallpaper or flooring.

Volcano Dungeon From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Volcano Dungeon's Entryway The Volcano Dungeon is located inside the volcano at the north end of Ginger Island, accessed through a large cave on the south side of the volcano. The dungeon consists of ten floors through which the player must proceed in sequence to reach the Forge, thereby "completing" the dungeon. Entering the cave, the player faces a lava river, across which lies the Volcano Dungeon. On the west side of the entryway is a pool of water. On its east side is a gate, initially locked, with a button on the floor to the south through the gate, out of reach. To cross the lava river and enter the dungeon, pour water on it with the watering can, creating a pathway to walk on.

Once across the lava river, the player can proceed north, past a few monsters and through the doorway, to enter the first floor of the dungeon.

Rock Crab From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Rock Crab Information Spawns In: The Mines Floors: 1-29 Killable: Yes Base HP: 30 Base Damage: 5 Base Def: 1 Speed: 2 XP: 4 Variations: Truffle Crab Lava Crab Iridium Crab Rock Crab (dangerous) Lava Crab (dangerous) Drops: Cherry Bomb (40%) Crab (15%) Dwarf Scroll I (0.5%) Dwarf Scroll IV (0.1%) If reached bottom of Mines: Diamond (0.05%) Prismatic Shard (0.05%) Rock Crabs are an enemy found in the Mines. 60 rock crabs (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild. Behavior They disguise themselves as stones, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack, though they can be hit with a pickaxe to knock them back, making them mobile again. Strategy Rock Crabs may be differentiated from rocks by striking them with a weapon. A Rock Crab will make a knocking sound and a zero damage indicator will pop up when hit with a weapon, while a rock will not. Hidden Rock Crabs can also be differentiated visually from rocks by a lighter shadow, as well as the presence of two brown pixels on the lower right-hand side of the rock where usually these would be black. In the image below, the Rock Crab is on the left, and a normal rock is on the right. The Rock Crab can only be dealt damage if it is mobile, and not hiding beneath its shell. Strike an immobile Rock Crab with a pickaxe to make it mobile again. Striking a Rock Crab with a pickaxe enough times will knock the shell off of its back, and will cause it to flee. Alternatively, setting off a bomb near a Rock Crab can remove its shell, and will cause it to flee as well.

Keg Productivity - Tiller From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search No Profession Tiller Artisan This page lists the productivity of processing Fruits, Vegetables, Coffee Beans, and Honey into Artisan Goods in a Keg. The products produced usually sell for more than the raw input items, so using a Keg is almost always profitable. Items that lose gold are highlighted in red, and items whose net increase in value is zero are highlighted in orange. The profit made from processing items is lowest when using iridium quality and highest when using regular quality items. Beer, Mead, Pale Ale, and Wine can be aged in a Cask to further increase their profit. The table below shows profit for regular quality processed items only. This table shows the profitability of processing items when the player has chosen the Tiller Profession (but not the Artisan Profession). To view the profitability for no profession or the Artisan Profession, use the links at the top of the page. Note that the processing times for a Keg vary, depending on the item used. Beer = 1,750 minutes Coffee = 120 minutes Green Tea = 180 minutes Juice = 6,000 minutes Mead = 600 minutes Pale Ale = 2,250 minutes Wine = 10,000 minutes For items that take less than a day to process (e.g., Coffee), the table calculates maximum profit assuming the player continually harvests and refills the keg during a 1600 minute day. [1] Productivity (g/minute) = ([Processed Sell Price] - [Input Item Sell Price]) / Processing Time Approximate g/day = Productivity (g/minute) * 1600 [1] Note that you may click on a column header to sort the table by that column, then Shift+Click on a second column to perform a secondary sort.

Moss From Stardew Valley Wiki Jump to navigation Jump to search Warning: Spoilers This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.6 of Stardew Valley. Players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article/section. Moss A special type of plant that grows in shady areas. Information Source Trees Weeds XP 1 Foraging XP Sell Price data-sort-value="5">5g Moss is a resource obtained from moss-covered trees. Each day in Spring, Summer, and Fall, some amount of common trees can randomly grow moss after certain time. Moss grows slower on Sunny Summer days. Additionally, two types of Green Rain Trees can grow Moss. Moss growth is accelerated for these two trees, and when covered in moss and planted near common trees accelerate moss growth on the common trees. [1] The trees do not need to be felled to collect the Moss. Moss can be removed and collected with any tool, weapon, or bomb. One Tree drops 1 to 2 pieces of Moss. Players can use Vinegar on a tree to prevent that tree from growing Moss. Using an Axe on a tapped tree covered in Moss will remove the Tapper and the Moss in one hit, while a Pickaxe will remove only the tapper on the first hit. Using any other methods will harvest moss without collecting the tapper. Moss becomes much more common during the Green Rain event, covering most mossy trees. This weather event also spawns exclusive weeds that have a 10% chance to drop Moss.[2] Additionally, Large Weeds spawned by the event will drop 2-3 Moss when cut.[3] Each Moss collected gives the player 1 Foraging XP.

It is one of the five Legendary Fish, so it can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer. The special requirements necessary to hook a Glacierfish are:[1] Fishing level 6, either naturally or using Fishing Buffs. The player must be standing on one specific tile: the one at the southernmost tip of Arrowhead Island. This exact location is revealed in Secrets of the Legendary Fish. The bobber must be located in water with a Fishing Zone of at least 3, i.e., it must be at least four tiles away from any land in every direction. The Glacierfish can appear one tile closer to land (Zone=2) if the bobber lands in Bubbles. When all of these requirements are met, each cast has a 50% chance of hooking a Glacierfish. Unlike with other Legendary Fish, using a Curiosity Lure does not increase the chance of hooking it. Although the Glacierfish cannot be hooked again after it is caught, it is possible to obtain multiple Glacierfish (per player) by using Challenge Bait to catch it or by Panning in the correct tiles with the Fisher enchantment. The Glacierfish can be caught regardless of season using Magic Bait. Contents 1 Map 2 Gifting 3 Bundles 4 Recipes 5 Dyeing 6 Quests 7 References 8
